	abstract = {An MR thermometry method is proposed for measuring in vivo small temperature changes engendered by external RF heat sources. The method relies on reproducible and stable respiration and therefore currently applies to ventilated animals whose breathing is carefully controlled. It first consists in characterizing the stability of the main magnetic field as well as the variations induced by breathing during a first monitoring stage. Second, RF heating is applied while the phase and thus temperature evolutions are continuously measured, the corrections due to breathing and field drift being made thanks to the data accumulated during the first period. The RF heat source is finally stopped and the temperature rise likewise is continuously monitored during a third and last stage to observe the animal cooling down and to validate the assumptions made for correcting for the main field variation and the physiological noise. Experiments were performed with a clinical 7 T scanner on an anesthetized baboon and with a dedicated RF heating setup. Analysis of the data reveals a precision around 0.1 degrees C, which allows us to reliably measure sub-degree temperature rises in the muscle and in the brain of the animal.

	abstract = {We have recently developed an optimized multi-spin echo (MSE) sequence dedicated to perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) imaging yielding an excellent sensitivity in vitro. The aim of the present study was to apply this sequence to quantitative measurements in the mouse liver and spleen after intravenous (i.v.) injection of PFOB emulsions. We first performed oxygenation maps 25.5 min after a single infusion of emulsion and, contrary to previous studies, shortly after injection. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the liver and spleen was as high as 45 and 120, respectively, for 3-min images with 11.7-μL pixels. Values of oxygen tension tended to be slightly higher in the spleen than in the liver. Dynamic biodistribution experiments were then performed immediately after intravenous (i.v.) injection of PFOB emulsions grafted with different quantities of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for stealth. Images were acquired every 7 min for 84 min and the SNR measured in the liver and spleen was at least four from the first time point. Uptake rates could be assessed for each PEG amount and, in spite of high standard deviations (SDs) owing to interanimal variability, our data confirmed that increasing quantities of PEG allow more gradual uptake of the emulsion particles by the liver and spleen. In conclusion, our method seems to be a powerful tool to non-invasively perform accurate in vivo quantitative measurements in the liver and spleen using (19)F MRI.},

	abstract = {Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumor in humans. To date, the only treatment of care consists of surgical removal of the tumor bulk, irradiation, and chemotherapy, finally resulting in a very poor prognosis due to the lack of efficiency in diagnostics. In this context, nanomedicine combining both diagnostic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and therapeutic applications is a relevant strategy referred to theranostic. Magnetic nanoparticles (NP) are excellent MRI contrast agents because of their large magnetic moment, which induces high transverse relaxivity (r2) characteristic and increased susceptibility effect (T2*). NP can be also used for drug delivery by coating their surface with therapeutic molecules. Preliminary in vitro studies show the high potential of caffeic acid (CA), a natural polyphenol, as a promising anticancer drug due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimetastatic properties. In this study, the antioxidative properties of iron oxide NP functionalized with caffeic acid (γFe2O3@CA NP) are investigated in vitro on U87-MG brain cancer cell lines. After intravenous injection of these NP in mice bearing a U87 glioblastoma, a negative contrast enhancement was specifically observed on 11.7 T MRI images in cancerous tissue, demonstrating a passive targeting of the tumor with these nanoplatforms.},

	abstract = {We examined the functional organization of cerebral activity in 3-month-old infants when they were listening to their mother language. Short sentences were presented in a slow event-related functional MRI paradigm. We then parsed the infant's network of perisylvian responsive regions into functionally distinct regions based on their speed of activation and sensitivity to sentence repetition. An adult-like structure of functional MRI response delays was observed along the superior temporal regions, suggesting a hierarchical processing scheme. The fastest responses were recorded in the vicinity of Heschl's gyrus, whereas responses became increasingly slower toward the posterior part of the superior temporal gyrus and toward the temporal poles and inferior frontal regions (Broca's area). Activation in the latter region increased when the sentence was repeated after a 14-s delay, suggesting the early involvement of Broca's area in verbal memory. The fact that Broca's area is active in infants before the babbling stage implies that activity in this region is not the consequence of sophisticated motor learning but, on the contrary, that this region may drive, through interactions with the perceptual system, the learning of the complex motor sequences required for future speech production. Our results point to a complex, hierarchical organization of the human brain in the first months of life, which may play a crucial role in language acquisition in our species.},

	abstract = {Delivery of therapeutic or diagnostic agents to the brain is majorly hindered by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Recently, many studies have demonstrated local and transient disruption of the BBB using low power ultrasound sonication combined with intravascular microbubbles. However, BBB opening and closure mechanisms are poorly understood, especially the maximum gap that may be safely generated between endothelial cells and the duration of opening of the BBB. Here, we studied BBB opening and closure under magnetic resonance (MR) guidance in a rat model. First, MR contrast agents (CA) of different hydrodynamic diameters (1 to 65 nm) were employed to estimate the largest molecular size permissible across the cerebral tissues. Second, to estimate the duration of the BBB opening, the CA were injected at various times post-BBB disruption (12 minutes to 24 hours). A T(1) mapping strategy was developed to assess CA concentration at the ultrasound (US) focal point. Based on our experimental data and BBB closure modeling, a calibration curve was obtained to compute the half closure time as a function of CA hydrodynamic diameter. These findings and the model provide an invaluable basis for optimal design and delivery of nanoparticles to the brain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a fast imaging technique that helps acquiring highly resolved images in space/time. Its performance depends on the reconstruction algorithm, which can proceed either in the k-space or in the image domain.
OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To improve the performance of the widely used SENSE algorithm, 2D regularization in the wavelet domain has been investigated. In this paper, we first extend this approach to 3D-wavelet representations and the 3D sparsity-promoting regularization term, in order to address reconstruction artifacts that propagate across adjacent slices. The resulting optimality criterion is convex but nonsmooth, and we resort to the parallel proximal algorithm to minimize it. Second, to account for temporal correlation between successive scans in functional MRI (fMRI), we extend our first contribution to 3D + t acquisition schemes by incorporating a prior along the time axis into the objective function.
RESULTS: Our first method (3D-UWR-SENSE) is validated on T1-MRI anatomical data for gray/white matter segmentation. The second method (4D-UWR-SENSE) is validated for detecting evoked activity during a fast event-related functional MRI protocol.
CONCLUSION: We show that our algorithm outperforms the SENSE reconstruction at the subject and group levels (15 subjects) for different contrasts of interest (motor or computation tasks) and two parallel acceleration factors (R = 2 and R = 4) on 2 × 2 × 3 MM(3) echo planar imaging (EPI) images.},

By varying the ratio of the two different PEG, we optimized the molecular architecture of the nanoplatform to obtain maximum stability and low toxicity under physiological conditions. The best nanoplatform was evaluated as MRI contrast for mouse brain vascularization imaging at 7 T. The carboxylic acid functions of the nanoplatform were used to covalently bind an antibody, Ab. This antibody, labeled with a fluorophore, targets the ETA receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor involved in the endothelin axis and overexpressed in various solid tumours, including ovarian, prostate, colon, breast, bladder and lung cancers. In vitro studies, performed by flow cytometry and magnetic quantification, showed the targeting efficiency of the Ab-nanoplatforms.

	abstract = {Stress is a well-established trigger for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, as it alters both structure and function of several brain regions and its networks. Herein, we conduct a longitudinal neuroimaging study to assess how a chronic unpredictable stress protocol impacts the structure of the rat brain and its functional connectome in both high and low responders to stress. Our results reveal the changes that stress triggers in the brain, with structural atrophy affecting key regions such as the prelimbic, cingulate, insular and retrosplenial, somatosensory, motor, auditory and perirhinal/entorhinal cortices, the hippocampus, the dorsomedial striatum, nucleus accumbens, the septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the thalamus and several brain stem nuclei. These structural changes are associated with increasing functional connectivity within a network composed by these regions. Moreover, using a clustering based on endocrine and behavioural outcomes, animals were classified as high and low responders to stress. We reveal that susceptible animals (high responders) develop local atrophy of the ventral tegmental area and an increase in functional connectivity between this area and the thalamus, further spreading to other areas that link the cognitive system with the fight-or-flight system. Through a longitudinal approach we were able to establish two distinct patterns, with functional changes occurring during the exposure to stress, but with an inflection point after the first week of stress when more prominent changes were seen. Finally, our study revealed differences in functional connectivity in a brainstem-limbic network that distinguishes resistant and susceptible responders before any exposure to stress, providing the first potential imaging-based predictive biomarkers of an individual's resilience/vulnerability to stressful conditions.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 5 December 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.244.},

	abstract = {Manual palpation is a common and very informative diagnostic tool based on estimation of changes in the stiffness of tissues that result from pathology. In the case of a small lesion or a lesion that is located deep within the body, it is difficult for changes in mechanical properties of tissue to be detected or evaluated via palpation. Furthermore, palpation is non-quantitative and cannot be used to localize the lesion. Magnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) can also be used to evaluate the properties of biological tissues non-invasively. In this study, an MRgFUS system combines high field (7T) MR and 3 MHz focused ultrasound to provide high resolution MR imaging and a small ultrasonic interrogation region (similar to 0.5 x 0.5 x 2 mm), as compared with current clinical systems. MR-Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (MR-ARFI) provides a reliable and efficient method for beam localization by detecting micron-scale displacements induced by ultrasound mechanical forces. The first aim of this study is to develop a sequence that can concurrently quantify acoustic radiation force displacements and image the resulting transient shear wave. Our motivation in combining these two measurements is to develop a technique that can rapidly provide both ARFI and shear wave velocity estimation data, making it suitable for use in interventional radiology. Secondly, we validate this sequence in vivo by estimating the displacement before and after high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation, and we validate the shear wave velocity in vitro using tissue-mimicking gelatin and tofu phantoms. Such rapid acquisitions are especially useful in interventional radiology applications where minimizing scan time is highly desirable.},

	abstract = {The characterization of extracellular space (ECS) architecture represents valuable information for the understanding of transport mechanisms occurring in brain parenchyma. ECS tortuosity reflects the hindrance imposed by cell membranes to molecular diffusion. Numerous strategies have been proposed to measure the diffusion through ECS and to estimate its tortuosity. The first method implies the perfusion for several hours of a radiotracer which effective diffusion coefficient D* is determined after post mortem processing. The most well-established techniques are real-time iontophoresis that measures the concentration of a specific ion at known distance from its release point, and integrative optical imaging that relies on acquiring microscopy images of macromolecules labelled with fluorophore. After presenting these methods, we focus on a recent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based technique that consists in acquiring concentration maps of a contrast agent diffusing within ECS. Thanks to MRI properties, molecular diffusion and tortuosity can be estimated in 3D for deep brain regions. To further discuss the reliability of this technique, we point out the influence of the delivery method on the estimation of D*. We compare the value of D* for a contrast agent intracerebrally injected, with its value when the agent is delivered to the brain after an ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeabilization. Several studies have already shown that tortuosity may be modified in pathological conditions. Therefore, we believe that MRI-based techniques could be useful in a clinical context for characterizing the diffusion properties of pathological ECS and thus predicting the drug biodistribution into the targeted area.},

Although acoustic parameters are reproducible in small animals, their control remains challenging in primates due to skull heterogeneity. This study describes a 7-T magnetic resonance (MR)-guided FUS system designed for BBB disruption in non-human primates (NHP) with a robust feedback control based on passive cavitation detection (PCD). Contrast enhanced T1-weighted MR images confirmed the BBB opening in NHP sonicated during 2 min with 500-kHz frequency, pulse length of 10 ms, and pulse repetition frequency of 5 Hz. The safe acoustic pressure range from 185 ± 22 kPa to 266 ± 4 kPa in one representative case was estimated from combining data from the acoustic beam profile with the BBB opening and hemorrhage profiles obtained from MR images. A maximum amount of MR contrast agent at focus was observed at 30 min after sonication with a relative contrast enhancement of 67\% ± 15\% (in comparison to that found in muscles). The feedback control based on PCD using relative spectra was shown to be robust, allowing comparisons across animals and experimental sessions. Finally, we also demonstrated that PCD can test acoustic coupling conditions, which improves the efficacy and safety of ultrasound transmission into the brain.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Low-intensity focused ultrasound has been shown to stimulate the brain noninvasively and without noticeable tissue damage. Such a noninvasive and localized neurostimulation is expected to have a major impact in neuroscience in the coming years. This emerging field will require many animal experiments to fully understand the link between ultrasound and stimulation. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate transcranial ultrasonic neurostimulation at low frequency (320 kHz) on anesthetized rats for different acoustic pressures and estimate the in situ pressure field distribution and the corresponding motor threshold, if any. The corresponding acoustic pressure distribution inside the brain, which cannot be measured in vivo, is investigated based on numerical simulations of the ultrasound propagation inside the head cavity, reproducing at best the experiments conducted in the first part, both in terms of transducer and head geometry and in terms of acoustic parameters.
METHODS: In this study, 37 ultrasonic neurostimulation sessions were achieved in rats (N=8) using a 320 kHz transducer. The corresponding beam profile in the entire head was simulated in order to investigate the in situ pressure and intensity level as well as the spatial pressure distribution, thanks to a rat microcomputed tomography scan (CT)-based 3D finite differences time domain solver.
RESULTS: Ultrasound pulse evoked a motor response in more than 60\% of the experimental sessions. In those sessions, the stimulation was always present, repeatable with a pressure threshold under which no motor response occurred. This average acoustic pressure threshold was found to be 0.68±0.1 MPa (corresponding mechanical index, MI=1.2 and spatial peak, pulse averaged intensity, Isppa=7.5 W cm(-2)), as calibrated in free water. A slight variation was observed between deep anesthesia stage (0.77±0.04 MPa) and light anesthesia stage (0.61±0.03 MPa), assessed from the pedal reflex. Several kinds of motor responses were observed: movements of the tail, the hind legs, the forelimbs, the eye, and even a single whisker were induced separately. Numerical simulations of an equivalent experiment with identical acoustic parameters showed that the acoustic field was spread over the whole rat brain with the presence of several secondary pressure peaks. Due to reverberations, a 1.8-fold increase of the spatial peak, temporal peak acoustic pressure (Psptp) (±0.4 standard deviation), a 3.6-fold increase (±1.8) for the spatial peak, temporal peak acoustic intensity (Isptp), and 2.3 for the spatial peak, pulse averaged acoustic intensity (Isppa), were found compared to simulations of the beam in free water. Applying such corrections due to reverberations on the experimental results would yield a higher estimation for the average acoustic pressure threshold for motor neurostimulation at 320 KHz at 1.2±0.3 MPa (MI=2.2±0.5 and Isppa=17.5±7.5 W cm(-2)).
CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation is pressure- and anesthesia-dependent in the rat model. Numerical simulations have shown that the acoustic pattern can be complex inside the rat head and that special care must be taken for small animal studies relating acoustic parameters to neurostimulation effects, especially at a low frequency.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Transcranial high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising approach for the treatment of brain tumours. Our objective is to validate a dedicated therapy monitoring system for rodents for transcranial HIFU therapy under MRI guidance in an in vivo brain tumour model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dedicated MR-compatible ultrasound therapy system and positioning frame was developed. Three MR-compatible prefocused ultrasonic monoelement transducers were designed, operating at 1.5 MHz and 2.5 MHz with different geometries. A full protocol of transcranial HIFU brain therapy under MRI guidance was applied in n = 19 rats without and n = 6 rats with transplanted tumours (RG2). Different heating strategies were tested. After treatment, histological study of the brain was performed in order to confirm thermal lesions.
RESULTS: Relying on a larger aperture and a higher frequency, the 2.5 MHz transducer was found to give better results than other ones. This single element transducer optimised the ratio of the temperature elevation at the focus to the one at the skull surface. Using optimised transducer and heating strategies enabled thermal necrosis both in normal and tumour tissues as verified by histology while limiting overheating in the tissues in contact with the skull.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a system for transcranial HIFU therapy guided by MRI was developed and tested in an in vivo rat brain tumour model. The feasibility of this therapy set-up to induce thermal lesions within brain tumours was demonstrated.},

These nanocapsules possess a shell of poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-PEG) and a liquid core of perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB). In vitro experiments show that mechanical effects such as cavitation are negligible for nanocapsules due to their small size and thick and rigid shell. As the mechanical effects were unable to increase paclitaxel delivery, we focused on the thermal effects of ultrasound in the in vivo studies. A focused ultrasound sequence was therefore optimized in vivo under magnetic resonance imaging guidance to obtain localized mild hyperthermia with high acoustic pressure. Ultrasound-induced mild hyperthermia (41-43°C) was then tested in vivo in a subcutaneous CT-26 colon cancer murine model. As hyperthermia is applied, an inhibition of tumor growth for both paclitaxel-loaded nanocapsules and the commercial formulation of paclitaxel, namely Taxol® have been observed (p{\textless}0.05). Ultrasound-induced mild hyperthermia at high acoustic pressure appears as an interesting strategy to enhance cytotoxic efficacy locally.},

The average regional activity statistical significance is assessed using the subject to subject variability of the effect (random effects analyses). Because of the relatively small number of subjects included, the sensitivity and reliability of these analyses is questionable and hard to investigate. In this work, we use a very large number of subject (more than 80) to investigate this issue. We take advantage of this large cohort to study the statistical properties of the inter-subject activity and focus on the notion of reproducibility by bootstrapping. We asked simple but important methodological questions: Is there, from the point of view of reliability, an optimal statistical threshold for activity maps? How many subjects should be included in group studies? What method should be preferred for inference? Our results suggest that i) optimal thresholds can indeed be found, and are rather lower than usual corrected for multiple comparison thresholds, ii) 20 subjects or more should be included in functional neuroimaging studies in order to have sufficient reliability, iii) non-parametric significance assessment should be preferred to parametric methods, iv) cluster-level thresholding is more reliable than voxel-based thresholding, and v) mixed effects tests are much more reliable than random effects tests. Moreover, our study shows that inter-subject variability plays a prominent role in the relatively low sensitivity and reliability of group studies.},

	abstract = {The PETRRA positron camera is a large-area (600 mm x 400 mm sensitive area) prototype system that has been developed through a collaboration between the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and the Institute of Cancer Research/Royal Marsden Hospital. The camera uses novel technology involving the coupling of 10 mm thick barium fluoride scintillating crystals to multi-wire proportional chambers filled with a photosensitive gas. The performance of the camera is reported here and shows that the present system has a 3D spatial resolution of approximately 7.5 mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), a timing resolution of approximately 3.5 ns (FWHM), a total coincidence count-rate performance of at least 80-90 kcps and a randoms-corrected sensitivity of approximately 8-10 kcps kBq(-1) ml. For an average concentration of 3 kBq ml(-1) as expected in a patient it is shown that, for the present prototype, approximately 20\% of the data would be true events. The count-rate performance is presently limited by the obsolete off-camera read-out electronics and computer system and the sensitivity by the use of thin (10 mm thick) crystals. The prototype camera has limited scatter rejection and no intrinsic shielding and is, therefore, susceptible to high levels of scatter and out-of-field activity when imaging patients. All these factors are being addressed to improve the performance of the camera. The large axial field-of-view of 400 mm makes the camera ideally suited to whole-body PET imaging. We present examples of preliminary clinical images taken with the prototype camera. Overall, the results show the potential for this alternative technology justifying further development.},

The lack of biological material and the absence of relevant models have hampered the development of new therapeutics. Their extensive infiltration of the brainstem renders any surgical resection impossible and until recently biopsies were considered not informative enough and therefore not recommended. Thus, most models were derived from autopsy material. We aimed to develop relevant in vivo DIPG models that mimic this specific disease and its molecular diversity from tumor material obtained at diagnosis. Eight patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models were obtained after direct stereotactic injection of a mixed cell suspension containing tumor cells and stromal cells in the brainstem or thalamus of nude mice and serially passaged thereafter. In parallel, we developed 6 cell-derived xenograft models after orthotopic injection of tumor-initiating cells cultured from stereotactic biopsies. Cells were modified to express luciferase to enable longitudinal tumor growth monitoring, and fluorescent reporter proteins to trace the tumor cells in the brain. These models do not form a tumor mass, they are invasive, show the H3K27 trimethylation loss in vivo and the tumor type diversity observed in patients in terms of histone H3 mutations and lineage markers. Histological and MRI features at 11.7 Tesla show similarities with treatment naïve human DIPG, and in this respect, both direct and indirect orthotopic xenograft looked alike. These DIPG models will therefore constitute valuable tools for evaluating new therapeutic approaches in this devastating disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound combined with microbubble injection is capable of locally and transiently enhancing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables to plan, monitor, and characterize the BBB disruption. Being able to precisely and remotely control the permeabilization location is of great interest to perform reproducible drug delivery protocols.
METHODS: In this study, we developed an MR-guided motorized focused ultrasound (FUS) system allowing the transducer displacement within preclinical MRI scanners, coupled with real-time transfer and reconstruction of MRI images, to help ultrasound guidance. Capabilities of this new device to deliver large molecules to the brain on either single locations or along arbitrary trajectories were characterized in vivo on healthy rats and mice using 1.5 MHz ultrasound sonications combined with microbubble injection. The efficacy of BBB permeabilization was assessed by injecting a gadolinium-based MR contrast agent that does not cross the intact BBB.
RESULTS: The compact motorized FUS system developed in this work fits into the 9-cm inner diameter of the gradient insert installed on our 7-T preclinical MRI scanners. MR images acquired after contrast agent injection confirmed that this device can be used to enhance BBB permeability along remotely controlled spatial trajectories of the FUS beam in both rats and mice. The two-axis motor stage enables reaching any region of interest in the rodent brain. The positioning error when targeting the same anatomical location on different animals was estimated to be smaller than 0.5 mm. Finally, this device was demonstrated to be useful for testing BBB opening at various acoustic pressures (0.2, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.9 MPa) in the same animal and during one single ultrasound session.
CONCLUSIONS: Our system offers the unique possibility to move the transducer within a high magnetic field preclinical MRI scanner, thus enabling the delivery of large molecules to virtually any rodent brain area in a non-invasive manner. It results in time-saving and reproducibility and could be used to either deliver drugs over large parts of the brain or test different acoustic conditions on the same animal during the same session, therefore reducing physiological variability.},

Animal models of repeated stress represent valuable tools to identify region-specific volumetric changes in the brain. Here, using high resolution 7T MRI, we found that amygdala is the most significant parameter for distinction between F344 and SD rats known to have differential response to stress. A significant substantial increase (45\%) was found in the amygdala volume of rats that do not habituate to the repeated stress procedure (F344 rats) compared to SD rats. This strain-specific effect of stress was evidenced by a significant strain-by-stress interaction. There were no significant strain differences in the volumes of hippocampi and prefrontal cortices though stress produces significant reductions of smaller amplitude in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (9\% and 12\%) and dorsal hippocampus (5\% and 6\%) in both strains. Our data further demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of high isotropic resolution structural ex vivo 7T MRI in the study of the brain effects of stress in small animals. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool to follow up brain volumetric reorganization during the stress response and could also be easily used to test pharmacological interventions to prevent the deleterious effects of stress.},

The method allows a multivariate comparison between data sets of several subjects in the time or in the space domain. These analyses assess the global intersubject variability before averaging subjects and drawing conclusions across subjects, at the population level. We adapt the RV coefficient to measure meaningful spatial or temporal similarities and use multidimensional scaling to give a visual representation of each subject's position with respect to other subjects in the group. We also provide a measure for detecting subjects that may be outliers. Results show that the method is a powerful tool to detect subjects with specific temporal or spatial patterns, and that, despite the apparent loss of information, restricting the analysis to a homogeneous subgroup of subjects does not reduce the statistical sensitivity of standard group fMRI analyses.},

	abstract = {In today's society, every individual is subjected to stressful stimuli with different intensities and duration. This exposure can be a key trigger in several mental illnesses greatly affecting one's quality of life. Yet not all subjects respond equally to the same stimulus and some are able to better adapt to them delaying the onset of its negative consequences. The neural specificities of this adaptation can be essential to understand the true dynamics of stress as well as to design new approaches to reduce its consequences. In the current work, we employed ex vivo high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to uncover the differences in white matter properties in the entire brain between Fisher 344 (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, known to present different responses to stress, and to examine the effects of a 2-week repeated inescapable stress paradigm. We applied a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis approach to a total of 25 animals. After exposure to stress, SD rats were found to have lower values of corticosterone when compared with F344 rats. Overall, stress was found to lead to an overall increase in fractional anisotropy (FA), on top of a reduction in mean and radial diffusivity (MD and RD) in several white matter bundles of the brain. No effect of strain on the white matter diffusion properties was observed. The strain-by-stress interaction revealed an effect on SD rats in MD, RD and axial diffusivity (AD), with lower diffusion metric levels on stressed animals. These effects were localized on the left side of the brain on the external capsule, corpus callosum, deep cerebral white matter, anterior commissure, endopiriform nucleus, dorsal hippocampus and amygdala fibers. The results possibly reveal an adaptation of the SD strain to the stressful stimuli through synaptic and structural plasticity processes, possibly reflecting learning processes.},

	title = {Localized and controlled drug delivery in rodent brain using focused ultrasounds under {MR} guidance},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Many studies have shown the capability to disrupt locally and transiently the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) with low power ultrasound sonication of intravascular microbubbles [1]. However, this technique requires an accurate control of the acoustic pressure in situ to avoid hemorrhages. In our work, the BBB opening procedure is done in rodents under MR guidance. The acoustic radiation force is mapped in vivo before the injection of microbubbles in order to calibrate the acoustic pressure to a desired value between disruption and hemorrhage thresholds [2]. Correlations of contrast agent concentration maps with MR-Acoustic Radiation Force Imaging (MR-ARFI) signals show that ARFI can be used to quantitatively predict drug delivery. MATERIALS AND METHODS. A 1.5MHz MR-compatible focused ultrasound transducer (F/D=0.8, F=20mm) was used inside a 7T preclinical scanner (Pharmascan, Bruker). Sprague Dawley rats were maintained in stereotactic position under isoflurane anesthesia. A multislice spin-echo sequence (TE/TR=40/1700ms, Tacq=4min, R=0.5x0.5x1mm3) was modified with additional motion sensitizing gradients and synchronized to ultrasonic bursts leading to a phase signal proportional to local acoustic intensity [2]. This MR-ARFI sequence was used to localize the ultrasound focus and estimate the acoustic pressure. An IR-TurboFLASH sequence (TE/TR=2.5/5ms, 60 TI spaced by 80ms, Tacq=13min) was used to generate T1 maps following the approach proposed in [3]. Then, rats were injected with Sonovue® microbubbles (Bracco, Italy) in the caudal vein (200μL, IV) and sonicated for 60s (3ms bursts every 100ms) with peak negative pressure between 0 and 0.55MPa. Those low pressure levels ensured safe and reversible BBB opening conditions. Dotarem® (gadolinium chelate contrast agent provided by Guerbet, France) was then injected (300μL, IV). T1 maps were acquired before and after Dotarem® injection to produce quantitative concentration maps. RESULTS. Global and focal BBB disruptions were obtained in vivo in rats through intact skulls. The MR-ARFI signal (Figure 1) was correlated to Dotarem® concentration map (Figure 2). A pixel to pixel analysis of coregistered maps for the two imaging modalities was performed (Figure 3). The increased penetration of Dotarem® in cerebral tissues was quantified and showed a clear threshold on acoustic pressure (around 0.3MPa). Significant Dotarem® penetration was observed above 0.35MPa. For a given molecular size, those data show that the spatial distribution of drug delivery can be predicted on the basis of ARFI signal. CONCLUSION. The ability to quantify contrast agent distribution in vivo within reasonable acquisition time with high sensitivity (∼5μM) and high resolution, together with the ability to reliably map the acoustic intensity thanks to a high sensitivity to motion (∼1μm), enable to calibrate both spatial extent and intensity of BBB opening. Once this calibration is known for a given molecular size, it is feasible to rely on ARFI signal to adjust the quantity of delivered drugs. REFERENCES.

Un-fortunately, given a sampling trajectory, it is not clear how to traverse it using gradient waveforms. In this paper, we actually show that ex-isting methods [1, 2] can yield large traversal time if the trajectory contains high curvature areas. Therefore, we consider here a new method for gradient waveform design which is based on the pro-jection of unrealistic initial trajectory onto the set of hardware con-straints. Next, we show on realistic simulations that this algorithm allows implementing variable density trajectories resulting from the piecewise linear solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem in a reasonable time. Finally, we demonstrate the application of this ap-proach to 2D MRI reconstruction and 3D angiography in the mouse brain.},

The T(2) of the CF(3) resonance of the molecule is measured using a multispin-echo sequence and shown to dramatically depend on the interpulse delay. Following these observations, an optimized multispin-echo imaging sequence is derived and compared with short TE/pulse repetition time gradient echo and chemical shift imaging sequences.

It was applied to estimate the hindered diffusion in brain tissues of five contrast agents with different hydrodynamic diameters (Dotarem(®) ≈ 1 nm, P846 ≈ 4 nm, P792 ≈ 7 nm, P904 ≈ 22 nm and Gd-based emulsion ≈ 170 nm). In vivo apparent diffusion coefficients were compared with those estimated in an obstacle-free medium to determine brain extracellular space and tortuosity. At a 2 h imaging timescale, all contrast agents except the Gd-based emulsion exhibited significant diffusion through brain tissues, with characteristic times compatible with MR molecular imaging ({\textless}70 min to diffuse between two capillaries). In conclusion, our experiments indicate that MRI contrast agents with sizes up to 22 nm can be used to perform molecular imaging on intra-cerebral biomarkers.

In this context, the specific nanoparticular contrast agent P03011, an USPIO (ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide) conjugated to a peptide that targets VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1), was developed to detect this major component of the vascular inflammatory response. This study aimed to make the proof of concept of the capacity of this targeted USPIO to detect VCAM-1 with MRI after cerebral ischemia in mouse. The time course of VCAM-1 expression was first examined by immunohistochemistry in our model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Secondly, P03011 or nontargeted USPIO P03007 were injected 5 h after ischemia (100 µmol iron kg⁻¹; i.v.) and in vivo and ex vivo MRI were performed 24 h after ischemia onset. Double labeling immunofluorescence was then performed on brain slices in order to detect both USPIO and VCAM-1. VCAM-1 expression was significantly up-regulated 24 h after ischemia in our model. In animals receiving P03011, both in vivo and ex vivo MRI performed 24 h after ischemia onset showed hypointense foci which could correspond to iron particles. Histological analysis showed a co-localization of the targeted USPIO and VCAM-1. This study demonstrates that VCAM-1 detection is possible with the USPIO P03011 in a model of cerebral ischemia. This kind of contrast agent could be an interesting clinical tool to characterize ischemic lesions in terms of vascular damage.},

Relaxation times were compared with values from the literature found at lower magnetic fields.
METHODS: (1) H NMR spectra were measured using a LASER localization sequence. T1 - and T2 -weighted spectra were analyzed using LCModel with an original parameterization of the macromolecule baseline.
RESULTS: The T1 relaxation times of 20 metabolites and the T2 relaxation times of 16 singlets and J-coupled metabolites were measured. The mean T1 and T2 relaxation times for metabolites were 1721 ± 237 ms and 148 ± 53 ms, respectively. In addition, we measured the T1 and T2 relaxation times of 4 macromolecule resonance groups, their mean T1 and T2 relaxation times being 690 ± 100 ms and 37 ± 15 ms, respectively. Absolute quantification of 21 metabolites and 4 groups of macromolecule resonances was achieved with Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds below 5\% for Cr, Gln, Glu, GPC, Ins, NAA, PCr, and Tau and below 25\% for the remaining resonances.
CONCLUSION: Comparison of our relaxation times to previously published values suggests a small increase of T1 values and a clear decrease of T2 values between 11.7 and 17.2T.},

The chemical exchange saturation transfer signal was ∼1\% in the tumor and controlateral regions, and decreased to ∼0.3\% after 2 h; while RGD-lipoCEST signal was ∼1.4\% in the tumor region and persisted for up to 2 h. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a persistent colocalization of RGD-lipoCEST with α(ν)β(3) receptors in the tumor region. These results constitute an encouraging step toward in vivo MRI imaging of tumor angiogenesis using intravenously injected lipoCEST.},

In this work, the potential of (19)F MRI was investigated to detect angiogenesis with α(ν)β(3)-targeted perfluorooctylbromide nanoparticles (PFOB NP) in a U87 glioblastoma mouse model at 7 Tesla. Mice were injected intravenously with targeted or non-targeted NP and (19)F images were immediately acquired for 90 min using a PFOB-dedicated MRI sequence. Mice infused with targeted NP exhibited higher concentrations in tumors than mice of the control group, despite the presence of nonspecific signal originating from the blood. Imaging results were corroborated by histology and fluorescence imaging, suggesting specific binding of targeted NP to α(ν)β(3) integrin. Two other groups of mice were injected 24 h before imaging to allow blood clearance but no significant differences were found between both groups, probably due to a loss of specificity of PFOB NP. This is the first demonstration of the ability of (19)F MRI to detect α(ν)β(3)-integrin endothelial expression in brain tumors in vivo.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cognitive processes such as reading and calculation are associated with reproducible cerebral networks, inter-individual variability is considerable. Understanding the origins of this variability will require the elaboration of large multimodal databases compiling behavioral, anatomical, genetic and functional neuroimaging data over hundreds of subjects. With this goal in mind, we designed a simple and fast acquisition procedure based on a 5-minute functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sequence that can be run as easily and as systematically as an anatomical scan, and is therefore used in every subject undergoing fMRI in our laboratory. This protocol captures the cerebral bases of auditory and visual perception, motor actions, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation at an individual level.
RESULTS: 81 subjects were successfully scanned. Before describing inter-individual variability, we demonstrated in the present study the reliability of individual functional data obtained with this short protocol. Considering the anatomical variability, we then needed to correctly describe individual functional networks in a voxel-free space. We applied then non-voxel based methods that automatically extract main features of individual patterns of activation: group analyses performed on these individual data not only converge to those reported with a more conventional voxel-based random effect analysis, but also keep information concerning variance in location and degrees of activation across subjects.
CONCLUSION: This collection of individual fMRI data will help to describe the cerebral inter-subject variability of the correlates of some language, calculation and sensorimotor tasks. In association with demographic, anatomical, behavioral and genetic data, this protocol will serve as the cornerstone to establish a hybrid database of hundreds of subjects suitable to study the range and causes of variation in the cerebral bases of numerous mental processes.},

The last part of this review focuses on the use of MNPs for magnetic-resonance-based amyloid imaging in biomedical fields, with particular attention to the application of gadolinium-based paramagnetic nanoparticles (AGuIX), which have been recently developed. Biocompatible AGuIX nanoparticles show favorable characteristics for in vivo use, such as nanometric and straightforward functionalization. Their properties have enabled their application in MRI.

              In this paper, we propose, design and test a new dual-nuclei RF-coil inspired by wire metamaterial structures. The coil operates as a result of resonant excitation of hybridized eigenmodes in multimode flat periodic structures comprising several coupled thin metal strips. It was shown that the field distribution of the coil (i.e. penetration depth) can be controlled independently at two different Larmor frequencies by selecting a proper eigenmode in each of two mutually orthogonal periodic structures. The proposed coil requires no lumped capacitors to be tuned and matched. In order to demonstrate the performance of the new design, an experimental preclinical coil for

Two families of ICMs can be distinguished: phase and envelope ICMs. The principles that shape these ICMs remain partly elusive, in particular their relation to the underlying brain structure. Here we explored structure-function relationships in the ferret brain between ICMs quantified from ongoing brain activity recorded with chronically implanted micro-ECoG arrays and structural connectivity (SC) obtained from high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography. Large-scale computational models were used to explore the ability to predict both types of ICMs. Importantly, all investigations were conducted with ICM measures that are sensitive or insensitive to volume conduction effects. The results show that both types of ICMs are significantly related to SC, except for phase ICMs when using measures removing zero-lag coupling. The correlation between SC and ICMs increases with increasing frequency which is accompanied by reduced delays. Computational models produced results that were highly dependent on the specific parameter settings. The most consistent predictions were derived from measures solely based on SC. Overall, the results demonstrate that patterns of cortical functional coupling as reflected in both phase and envelope ICMs are both related, albeit to different degrees, to the underlying structural connectivity in the cerebral cortex.},

	abstract = {The P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) is a major efflux transporter which impedes the brain delivery of many drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Focused ultrasound with microbubbles (FUS) enables BBB disruption, which immediate and delayed impact on P-gp function remains unclear. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the radiolabeled substrate [11C]metoclopramide provides a sensitive and translational method to study P-gp function at the living BBB. A FUS protocol was devised in rats to induce a substantial and targeted disruption of the BBB in the left hemisphere. BBB disruption was confirmed by the Evan's Blue extravasation test or the minimally-invasive contrast-enhanced MRI. The expression of P-gp was measured 24 h or 48 h after FUS using immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. The brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide was studied by PET at baseline, and both immediately or 24 h after FUS, with or without half-maximum P-gp inhibition (tariquidar 1 mg/kg). In each condition (n = 4-5 rats per group), brain exposure of [11C]metoclopramide was estimated as the area-under-the-curve (AUC) in regions corresponding to the sonicated volume in the left hemisphere, and the contralateral volume. Kinetic modeling was performed to estimate the uptake clearance ratio (R1) of [11C]metoclopramide in the sonicated volume relative to the contralateral volume. In the absence of FUS, half-maximum P-gp inhibition increased brain exposure (+135.0 ± 12.9\%, p {\textless} 0.05) but did not impact R1 (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Immediately after FUS, BBB integrity was selectively disrupted in the left hemisphere without any detectable impact on the brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide compared with the baseline group (p {\textgreater} 0.05) or the contralateral volume (p {\textgreater} 0.05). 24 h after FUS, BBB integrity was fully restored while P-gp expression was maximally down-regulated (-45.0 ± 4.5\%, p {\textless} 0.001) in the sonicated volume. This neither impacted AUC nor R1 in the FUS + 24 h group (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Only when P-gp was inhibited with tariquidar were the brain exposure (+130 ± 70\%) and R1(+29.1 ± 15.4\%) significantly increased in the FUS + 24 h/tariquidar group, relative to the baseline group (p {\textless} 0.001). We conclude that the brain kinetics of [11C]metoclopramide specifically depends on P-gp function rather than BBB integrity. Delayed FUS-induced down-regulation of P-gp function can be detected. Our results suggest that almost complete down-regulation is required to substantially enhance the brain delivery of P-gp substrates.},

Endothelin A receptor (ETA) overexpression in GSCs constitutes an attractive biomarker for targeting this cell subpopulation, as illustrated by several clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists against GBM. In this context, we have designed an immunoPET radioligand combining the chimeric antibody targeting ETA, chimeric-Rendomab A63 (xiRA63), with 89Zr isotope and evaluated the abilities of xiRA63 and its Fab (ThioFab-xiRA63) to detect ETA+ tumors in a mouse model xenografted orthotopically with patient-derived Gli7 GSCs.
RESULTS: Radioligands were intravenously injected and imaged over time by µPET-CT imaging. Tissue biodistribution and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed, highlighting the ability of [89Zr]Zr-xiRA63 to pass across the brain tumor barrier and achieve better tumor uptake than [89Zr]Zr-ThioFab-xiRA63.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the high potential of [89Zr]Zr-xiRA63 in specifically targeting ETA+ tumors, thus raising the possibility of detecting and treating ETA+ GSCs, which could improve the management of GBM patients.},

	abstract = {Aim: Gene-based immunotherapy against cancer is limited by low gene transfer efficiency. In the literature, interleukin-12 (IL-12) encoding plasmid associated with sonoporation has been shown to enhance antitumoral activity. Moreover, non-viral carriers and high-frequency ultrasound have both been shown to promote immune response activation. Here, IL-12 encoding plasmid, non-viral carrier stimulating the immune response and focused ultrasound were combined in order to improve the antitumoral efficiency.
Methods: In order to enhance a gene-based antitumoral immune response, home-made lipids Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists and plasmid free of antibiotic resistance version 4 (pFAR4), a mini-plasmid, encoding the IL-12 cytokine were combined with high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU). The lipid composition and the combination conditions were selected following in vitro and in vivo preliminary studies. The expression of IL-12 from our plasmid construct was measured in vitro and in vivo. The combination strategy was evaluated in mice bearing colon carcinoma cells (CT26) tumors following their weight, tumor volume, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels in the serum and produced by splenocytes exposed to CT26 tumor cells.
Results: Lipid-mediated cell transfection and intratumoral injection into CT26 tumor mice using pFAR4-IL-12 led to the secretion of the IL-12 cytokine into cell supernatant and mice sera, respectively. Conditions of thermal deposition using HIFU were optimized. The plasmid encoding pFAR4-IL-12 or TLR2 agonist alone had no impact on tumor growth compared with control mice, whereas the complete treatment consisting of pFAR4-IL-12, TLR2 lipid agonist, and HIFU limited tumor growth. Moreover, only the complete treatment increased significantly mice survival and provided an abscopal effect on a metastatic CT26 model.
Conclusions: The HIFU condition was highly efficient to stop tumor growth. The combined therapy was the most efficient in terms of IL-12 and IFN-γ production and mice survival. The study showed the feasibility and the limits of this combined therapy which has the potential to be improved.},

	abstract = {The management of brain diseases remains a challenge, particularly because of the difficulty for drugs to cross the blood–brain barrier. Among strategies developed to improve drug delivery, nano-sized emulsions (i.e., nanoemulsions), employed as nanocarriers, have been described. Moreover, focused ultrasound-mediated blood–brain barrier disruption using microbubbles is an attractive method to overcome this barrier, showing promising results in clinical trials. Therefore, nanoemulsions combined with this technology represent a real opportunity to bypass the constraints imposed by the blood–brain barrier and improve the treatment of brain diseases. In this work, a stable freeze-dried emulsion of perfluorooctyl bromide nanodroplets stabilized with home-made fluorinated surfactants able to carry hydrophobic agents is developed. This formulation is biocompatible and droplets composing the emulsion are internalized in multiple cell lines. After intravenous administration in mice, droplets are eliminated from the bloodstream in 24 h (blood half-life (t1/2) = 3.11 h) and no long-term toxicity is expected since they are completely excreted from mice’ bodies after 72 h. In addition, intracerebral accumulation of tagged droplets is safely and significantly increased after focused ultrasound-mediated blood–brain barrier disruption. Thus, the proposed nanoemulsion appears as a promising nanocarrier for a successful focused ultrasound-mediated brain delivery of hydrophobic agents.},

Brain tumors present multiple obstacles that make therapeutic innovation complex, mainly due to the presence of blood-tumor and blood-brain barriers (BTB and BBB, respectively) which prevent penetration of anticancer agents into the brain parenchyma. Focused ultrasound-mediated BBB disruption (FUS-BBBD) provides a physical method for non-invasive, local, and reversible BBB disruption. The safety of this technique has been demonstrated in small and large animal models. This approach promises to enhance drug delivery into the brain tumor and therefore to improve survival outcomes by repurposing existing drugs. Several clinical trials continue to be initiated in the last decade. In this review, we provide an overview of the rationale behind the use of FUS-BBBD in gliomas and summarize the preclinical studies investigating different approaches (free drugs, drug-loaded microbubbles and drug-loaded nanocarriers) in combination with this technology in in vivo glioma models.

Transient disruption of the BBB by focused ultrasound (FUS) is a promising and safe approach to increase the brain and tumor concentration of drugs administered systemically. Non-invasive, sensitive, and reliable imaging approaches are required to better understand the impact of FUS on the BBB and brain microenvironment. In this study, nuclear imaging (SPECT/CT and PET/CT) was used to quantify neuroinflammation 48 h post-FUS and estimate the influence of FUS on BBB opening and tumor growth in vivo. BBB disruptions were performed on healthy and GBM-bearing mice (U-87 MG xenograft orthotopic model). The BBB recovery kinetics were followed and quantified by [99mTc]Tc-DTPA SPECT/CT imaging at 0.5 h, 3 h and 24 h post-FUS. The absence of neuroinflammation was confirmed by [18F]FDG PET/CT imaging 48 h post-FUS. The presence of the tumor and its growth were evaluated by [68Ga]Ga-RGD2 PET/CT imaging and post-mortem histological analysis, showing that tumor growth was not influenced by FUS. In conclusion, molecular imaging can be used to evaluate the time frame for systemic treatment combined with transient BBB opening and to test its efficacy over time.},

[18F]FDS was straightforwardly produced from chemical reduction of commercial [18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose. [18F]FDS and the invasive BBB integrity marker Evan’s blue (EB) were i.v. injected in mice after an optimized FUS protocol designed to generate controlled hemispheric BBB disruption. Quantitative determination of the impact of FUS on the BBB permeability was determined using kinetic modeling. A 2.2 ± 0.5-fold higher PET signal (n = 5; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) was obtained in the sonicated hemisphere and colocalized with EB staining observed post mortem. FUS significantly increased the blood-to-brain distribution of [18F]FDS by 2.4 ± 0.8-fold (VT; p {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). Low variability (=10.1\%) of VT values in the sonicated hemisphere suggests reproducibility of the estimation of BBB permeability and FUS method.

              Fifty million people worldwide are affected by dementia, a heterogeneous neurodegenerative condition encompassing diseases such as Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, and Parkinson’s. For them, cognitive decline is often the first marker of the pathology after irreversible brain damage has already occurred. Researchers now believe that structural and functional alterations of the brain vasculature could be early precursors of the diseases and are looking at how functional imaging could provide an early diagnosis years before irreversible clinical symptoms. In this preclinical pilot study, we proposed using functional ultrasound (fUS) on the retina to assess neurovascular alterations non-invasively, bypassing the skull limitation. We demonstrated for the first time the use of functional ultrasound in the retina and applied it to characterize the retinal hemodynamic response function in vivo in rats following a visual stimulus
              .
              We then demonstrated that retinal fUS could measure robust neurovascular coupling alterations between wild-type rats and TgF344-AD rat models of Alzheimer’s disease. We observed an average relative increase in blood volume of 21\% in the WT versus 37\% for the TG group (
              p
               = 0.019). As a portable, non-invasive and inexpensive technique, rfUS is a promising functional screening tool in clinics for dementia years before symptoms.},

	abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls brain homeostasis; it is formed by vascular endothelial cells that are physically connected by tight junctions (TJs). The BBB expresses efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which limit the passage of substrate molecules from blood circulation to the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles can create a local and reversible detachment of the TJs. However, very little is known about the effect of FUS on the expression of efflux transporters. We investigated the in vivo effects of moderate acoustic pressures on both P-gp and BCRP expression for up to two weeks after sonication. Magnetic resonance-guided FUS was applied in the striatum of 12 rats. P-gp and BCRP expression were determined by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days postFUS. Our results indicate that FUS-induced BBB opening is capable of (i) decreasing P-gp expression up to 3 days after sonication in both the treated and in the contralateral brain regions and is capable of (ii) overexpressing BCRP up to 7 days after FUS in the sonicated regions only. Our findings may help improve FUS-aided drug delivery strategies by considering both the mechanical effect on the TJs and the regulation of P-gp and BCRP.},

The central nervous system (CNS) is the target of many gene therapy protocols, but its high complexity makes it one of the most difficult organs to reach, in part due to the blood-brain barrier that protects it from external threats. Focused ultrasound (FUS) coupled with microbubbles appears as a technological breakthrough to deliver therapeutic agents into the CNS. While most studies focus on a specific targeted area of the brain, the present work proposes to permeabilize the entire brain for gene therapy in several pathologies. Our results show that, after i.v. administration and FUS sonication in a raster scan manner, a self-complementary AAV9-CMV-GFP vector strongly and safely infected the whole brain of mice. An increase in vector DNA (19.8 times), GFP mRNA (16.4 times), and GFP protein levels (17.4 times) was measured in whole brain extracts of FUS-treated GFP injected mice compared to non-FUS GFP injected mice. In addition to this increase in GFP levels, on average, a 7.3-fold increase of infected cells in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum was observed. No side effects were detected in the brain of treated mice. The combining of FUS and AAV-based gene delivery represents a significant improvement in the treatment of neurological genetic diseases.},

The presence of reactive astrocytes in MS lesions has been described for a long time; however, the role that these cells play in the pathophysiology of MS is still not fully understood. Recently, we used an MS animal model to perform high-throughput sequencing of astrocytes’ transcriptome during disease progression. Our data show that astrocytes isolated from the cerebellum (a brain region typically affected in MS) showed a strong alteration in the genes that encode for proteins related to several metabolic pathways. Specifically, we found a significant increase in glycogen degradation, glycolytic, and TCA cycle enzymes. Together with these alterations, we detected an upregulation of genes that characterize “astrocyte reactivity”. Additionally, at each disease time point we also reconstructed the morphology of cerebellum astrocytes in non-induced controls and in EAE animals, near lesion regions and in the normal-appearing white mater (NAWM). We found that near lesions, astrocytes presented increased length and complexity compared to control astrocytes, while no significant alterations were observed in the NAWM. How these metabolic alterations are linked with disease progression is yet to be uncovered. Herein, we bring to the literature the hypothesis of performing metabolic reprogramming as a novel therapeutic approach in MS.},

This contribution provides an overview of the MNPs mainly used in the field of amyloid diseases. The first part discusses their use in understanding the amyloid mechanisms of fibrillation, with emphasis on their ability to control aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins. The second part deals with the functionalization by various moieties of numerous MNPs’ surfaces (molecules, peptides, antibody fragments, or whole antibodies of MNPs) for the detection and the quantification of amyloid aggregates. The last part of this review focuses on the use of MNPs for magnetic-resonance-based amyloid imaging in biomedical fields, with particular attention to the application of gadolinium-based paramagnetic nanoparticles (AGuIX), which have been recently developed. Biocompatible AGuIX nanoparticles show favorable characteristics for in vivo use, such as nanometric and straightforward functionalization. Their properties have enabled their application in MRI. Here, we report that AGuIX nanoparticles grafted with the Pittsburgh compound B can actively target amyloid aggregates in the brain, beyond the blood–brain barrier, and remain the first step in observing amyloid plaques in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Assess short-term and long-term effects of chronic exposure to an ultrahigh static magnetic (B0 ) field on mice inner ear in the context of MR safety of human scanning at 11.7 T.
METHODS: Mice were chronically exposed to a B0 field of 11.7 T or 17.2 T during ten 2-h exposure sessions evenly distributed over a period of 5 weeks, resulting in a total of 20 h of exposure per mouse. During exposure sessions, mice were anesthetized and positioned either parallel or antiparallel to B0 . Before, during, and 2 weeks after the magnetic-field exposure period, mice performed behavioral tests (balance beam, rotarod, and swim tests) to evaluate their short-term and long-term motor coordination and balance. An auditory brainstem response (ABR) test was finally performed to assess the functional integrity of mice cochlea, 2 weeks after the last exposure.
RESULTS: After awaking from anesthesia following B0 exposures at 11.7 Tor 17.2 T, mice displayed a transient ({\textless}5 min) rotating behavior. The behavioral tests did not show any difference between the exposed and the control mice at any time point. Determination of ABR thresholds did not reveal an impairment of cochlea hair cells resulting from chronic B0 exposure.
CONCLUSION: Despite the transient disturbance of mice vestibular system observed immediately after B0 exposure, no short-term nor long-term alteration was detected with behavioral and ABR tests.},

Two families of ICMs can be distinguished: phase and envelope ICMs. The principles that shape these ICMs remain partly elusive, in particular their relation to the underlying brain structure. Here we explored structure-function relationships in the ferret brain between ICMs quantified from ongoing brain activity recorded with chronically implanted micro-ECoG arrays and structural connectivity (SC) obtained from high-resolution diffusion MRI tractography. Large-scale computational models were used to explore the ability to predict both types of ICMs. Importantly, all investigations were conducted with ICM measures that are sensitive or insensitive to volume conduction effects. The results show that both types of ICMs are significantly related to SC, except for phase ICMs when using measures removing zero-lag coupling. The correlation between SC and ICMs increases with increasing frequency which is accompanied by reduced delays. Computational models produced results that were highly dependent on the specific parameter settings. The most consistent predictions were derived from measures solely based on SC. Overall, the results demonstrate that patterns of cortical functional coupling as reflected in both phase and envelope ICMs are both related, albeit to different degrees, to the underlying structural connectivity in the cerebral cortex.},

Some disadvantages of MRI are the availability of MRI scanners and the time required for a full scanning session. Privacy laws and the 3Rs ethics rule also make it difficult to create large datasets for training deep learning models. To overcome these challenges, an adaptation of the alpha Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) architecture was used to test its ability to generate realistic 3D MRI scans of the rat brain in silico. As far as the authors are aware, this was the first time a GAN-based approach was used to generate synthetic MRI data of the rat brain. The generated scans were evaluated using various quantitative metrics, a Turing test, and a segmentation test. The last two tests proved the realism and applicability of the generated scans to real problems. Therefore, by using the proposed new normalisation layer and loss functions, it was possible to improve the realism of the generated rat MRI scans, and it was shown that using the generated data improved the segmentation model more than using the conventional data augmentation.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Electromagnetic radiation-triggered therapeutic effect has attracted a great interest over the last 50 years. However, translation to clinical applications of photoactive molecular systems developed to date is dramatically limited, mainly because their activation requires excitation by low-energy photons from the ultraviolet to near infra-red range, preventing any activation deeper than few millimetres under the skin. Herein we conceive a strategy for photosensitive-system activation potentially adapted to biological tissues without any restriction in depth. High-energy stimuli, such as those employed for radiotherapy, are used to carry energy while molecular activation is provided by local energy conversion. This concept is applied to azobenzene, one of the most established photoswitches, to build a radioswitch. The radiation-responsive molecular system developed is used to trigger cytotoxic effect on cancer cells upon gamma-ray irradiation. This breakthrough activation concept is expected to expand the scope of applications of photosensitive systems and paves the way towards the development of original therapeutic approaches.},

	abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) controls brain homeostasis; it is formed by vascular endothelial cells that are physically connected by tight junctions (TJs). The BBB expresses efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which limit the passage of substrate molecules from blood circulation to the brain. Focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles can create a local and reversible detachment of the TJs. However, very little is known about the effect of FUS on the expression of efflux transporters. We investigated the in vivo effects of moderate acoustic pressures on both P-gp and BCRP expression for up to two weeks after sonication. Magnetic resonance-guided FUS was applied in the striatum of 12 rats. P-gp and BCRP expression were determined by immunohistochemistry at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days postFUS. Our results indicate that FUS-induced BBB opening is capable of (i) decreasing P-gp expression up to 3 days after sonication in both the treated and in the contralateral brain regions and is capable of (ii) overexpressing BCRP up to 7 days after FUS in the sonicated regions only. Our findings may help improve FUS-aided drug delivery strategies by considering both the mechanical effect on the TJs and the regulation of P-gp and BCRP.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The role of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) in conscious perception is debated. The global neuronal workspace theory of consciousness predicts that PFC neurons should contain a detailed code of the current conscious contents. Previous research showed that PFC is indeed activated in paradigms of conscious visual perception, including no-report paradigms where no voluntary behavioral report of the percept is given, thus avoiding a conflation of signals related to visual consciousness with signals related to the report. Still, it has been argued that prefrontal modulation could reflect post-perceptual processes that may be present even in the absence of report, such as thinking about the perceived stimulus, therefore reflecting a consequence rather than a direct correlate of conscious experience. Here, we investigate these issues by recording neuronal ensemble activity from the macaque ventrolateral PFC during briefly presented visual stimuli, either in isolated trials in which stimuli were clearly perceived or in sequences of rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) in which perception and post-perceptual processing were challenged. We report that the identity of each stimulus could be decoded from PFC population activity even in the RSVP condition. The first visual signals could be detected at 60 ms after stimulus onset and information was maximal at 150 ms. However, in the RSVP condition, 200 ms after the onset of a stimulus, the decoding accuracy quickly dropped to chance level and the next stimulus started to be decodable. Interestingly, decoding in the ventrolateral PFC was stronger compared to posterior parietal cortex for both isolated and RSVP stimuli. These results indicate that neuronal populations in the macaque PFC reliably encode visual stimuli even under conditions that have been shown to challenge conscious perception and/or substantially reduce the probability of post-perceptual processing in humans. We discuss whether the observed activation reflects conscious access, phenomenal consciousness, or merely a preconscious bottom-up wave.},
