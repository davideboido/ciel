However, the technique comes at the expense of significant experimental difficulties. In this review we focus on the experimental aspects of non-hyperpolarized 13C MRS in vivo. Some of the enrichment strategies which have been proposed so far are described; the various MRS acquisition paradigms to measure 13C labeling are then presented. Finally, practical aspects of 13C spectral quantification are discussed.},

	abstract = {Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) probes issued from the encapsulation of a water proton paramagnetic shift reagent into the inner aqueous volume of lipid vesicles provide an emerging class of frequency-selective contrast agents with huge potential in the field of molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This work deals with the generation of such LipoCEST agents properly designed to optimize, under isotonic conditions, the chemical shift offset of the intra-liposomal water protons as well as the number of exchangeable protons under reasonably low radiofrequency (RF) fields of saturation. The strategy lies in the loading of poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized nanosized liposomes with uncharged lanthanide chelates, binding more than one water molecule in the first hydration sphere, exemplified here by [Tm(III)-DO3A (H2 O)2 ] complex. The key properties of the probes are demonstrated by complementary NMR investigations. The residence lifetime of the water molecules coordinated to the lanthanide center was outstandingly short (9.5 ± 0.2 ns from (17) O NMR), and indeed relevant for effective LipoCEST responsiveness. The (1) H NMR CEST spectra (7.01 T magnetic field) prove that the theoretically expected optimal sensitivity can be approximated in the nanomolar concentration range, at reasonably low RF presaturation pulses (6.7-12 μT) and saturation frequency offsets of the intra-liposomal water protons beyond 10 ppm, making possible selective irradiation in biological environment. CEST-MRI images (7.01 T magnetic field and 10-12 μT RF pulse) explicitly confirm the interest of these newly conceived LipoCEST agents, indeed among the most efficient ones developed so far under isosmotic conditions.},

	abstract = {Lithium is the first-line mood stabilizer for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. However, its mechanisms of action and transport across the blood-brain barrier remain poorly understood. The contribution of lithium-7 magnetic resonance imaging (7 Li MRI) to investigate brain lithium distribution remains limited because of the modest sensitivity of the lithium nucleus and the expected low brain concentrations in humans and animal models. Therefore, we decided to image lithium distribution in the rat brain ex vivo using a turbo-spin-echo imaging sequence at 17.2 T. The estimation of lithium concentrations was performed using a phantom replacement approach accounting for B1 inhomogeneities and differential T1 and T2 weighting. Our MRI-derived lithium concentrations were validated by comparison with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurements ([Li]MRI  = 1.18[Li]MS , R = 0.95). Overall, a sensitivity of 0.03 mmol/L was achieved for a spatial resolution of 16 μL. Lithium distribution was uneven throughout the brain (normalized lithium content ranged from 0.4 to 1.4) and was mostly symmetrical, with consistently lower concentrations in the metencephalon (cerebellum and brainstem) and higher concentrations in the cortex. Interestingly, low lithium concentrations were also observed close to the lateral ventricles. The average brain-to-plasma lithium ratio was 0.34 ± 0.04, ranging from 0.29 to 0.39. Brain lithium concentrations were reasonably correlated with plasma lithium concentrations, with Pearson correlation factors ranging from 0.63 to 0.90.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of brain tumors, but it may lead to severe cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown that ionizing irradiation induces demyelination, blood-brain barrier alterations, and impaired neurogenesis in animal models. Hence, noninvasive and sensitive biomarkers of irradiation injury are needed to investigate these effects in patients and improve radiation therapy protocols.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The heads of 3-month-old male C57BL/6RJ mice (15 control mice and 15 irradiated mice) were exposed to radiation doses of 3 fractions of 5 Gy from a 60Co source with a medical irradiator. A longitudinal study was performed to investigate cranial irradiation-induced (3 fractions of 5 Gy) microstructural tissue alterations using water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in different areas of the mouse brain (cortex, thalamus, striatum, olfactory bulbs [OBs], hippocampus, and subventricular zone [SVZ]). In addition to the quantification of standard non-Gaussian diffusion parameters, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC0) and kurtosis (K), we evaluated a new composite diffusion metric, designated the S-index (ie, "signature index").
RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in the S-index in the SVZ from 1 month to 8 months after brain irradiation (P {\textless} .05). An interesting finding was that, along with a decrease in taurine levels (up to -15\% at 2 months, P {\textless} .01), a delayed S-index drop was observed in the OBs from 4 months after irradiation and maintained until the end of our experiment (P {\textless} .0001). These observations suggest that S-index variations revealed the irradiation-induced decline of neurogenesis that was further confirmed by a decrease in neural stem cells in the SVZ and in newborn neurons in the OBs of irradiated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, especially through the S-index approach, is a relevant imaging modality to monitor brain irradiation injury and probe microstructural changes underlying irradiation-induced cognitive deficits.},

	abstract = {Stress is a well-established trigger for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, as it alters both structure and function of several brain regions and its networks. Herein, we conduct a longitudinal neuroimaging study to assess how a chronic unpredictable stress protocol impacts the structure of the rat brain and its functional connectome in both high and low responders to stress. Our results reveal the changes that stress triggers in the brain, with structural atrophy affecting key regions such as the prelimbic, cingulate, insular and retrosplenial, somatosensory, motor, auditory and perirhinal/entorhinal cortices, the hippocampus, the dorsomedial striatum, nucleus accumbens, the septum, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the thalamus and several brain stem nuclei. These structural changes are associated with increasing functional connectivity within a network composed by these regions. Moreover, using a clustering based on endocrine and behavioural outcomes, animals were classified as high and low responders to stress. We reveal that susceptible animals (high responders) develop local atrophy of the ventral tegmental area and an increase in functional connectivity between this area and the thalamus, further spreading to other areas that link the cognitive system with the fight-or-flight system. Through a longitudinal approach we were able to establish two distinct patterns, with functional changes occurring during the exposure to stress, but with an inflection point after the first week of stress when more prominent changes were seen. Finally, our study revealed differences in functional connectivity in a brainstem-limbic network that distinguishes resistant and susceptible responders before any exposure to stress, providing the first potential imaging-based predictive biomarkers of an individual's resilience/vulnerability to stressful conditions.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 5 December 2017; doi:10.1038/mp.2017.244.},

	abstract = {Stress is known to precipitate psychiatric disorders in vulnerable people. Individual differences in the stress responsivity can dramatically affect the onset of these illnesses. Animal models of repeated stress represent valuable tools to identify region-specific volumetric changes in the brain. Here, using high resolution 7T MRI, we found that amygdala is the most significant parameter for distinction between F344 and SD rats known to have differential response to stress. A significant substantial increase (45\%) was found in the amygdala volume of rats that do not habituate to the repeated stress procedure (F344 rats) compared to SD rats. This strain-specific effect of stress was evidenced by a significant strain-by-stress interaction. There were no significant strain differences in the volumes of hippocampi and prefrontal cortices though stress produces significant reductions of smaller amplitude in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (9\% and 12\%) and dorsal hippocampus (5\% and 6\%) in both strains. Our data further demonstrate the feasibility and relevance of high isotropic resolution structural ex vivo 7T MRI in the study of the brain effects of stress in small animals. Neuroimaging is a valuable tool to follow up brain volumetric reorganization during the stress response and could also be easily used to test pharmacological interventions to prevent the deleterious effects of stress.},

	abstract = {In today's society, every individual is subjected to stressful stimuli with different intensities and duration. This exposure can be a key trigger in several mental illnesses greatly affecting one's quality of life. Yet not all subjects respond equally to the same stimulus and some are able to better adapt to them delaying the onset of its negative consequences. The neural specificities of this adaptation can be essential to understand the true dynamics of stress as well as to design new approaches to reduce its consequences. In the current work, we employed ex vivo high field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to uncover the differences in white matter properties in the entire brain between Fisher 344 (F344) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, known to present different responses to stress, and to examine the effects of a 2-week repeated inescapable stress paradigm. We applied a tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis approach to a total of 25 animals. After exposure to stress, SD rats were found to have lower values of corticosterone when compared with F344 rats. Overall, stress was found to lead to an overall increase in fractional anisotropy (FA), on top of a reduction in mean and radial diffusivity (MD and RD) in several white matter bundles of the brain. No effect of strain on the white matter diffusion properties was observed. The strain-by-stress interaction revealed an effect on SD rats in MD, RD and axial diffusivity (AD), with lower diffusion metric levels on stressed animals. These effects were localized on the left side of the brain on the external capsule, corpus callosum, deep cerebral white matter, anterior commissure, endopiriform nucleus, dorsal hippocampus and amygdala fibers. The results possibly reveal an adaptation of the SD strain to the stressful stimuli through synaptic and structural plasticity processes, possibly reflecting learning processes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To map B(0) distortions throughout the monkey brain in the two positions commonly used for NMR studies (the prone sphinx position and the supine position) in order to test the hypothesis that B(0) homogeneity in the sphinx position is significantly improved as compared to the supine position. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three macaque monkeys were installed in the two positions in a 3T whole-body MR system without shim correction. B(0) maps were acquired using a 3D gradient double-echo sequence, and field dispersion throughout the brain was quantified. In addition, field maps and localized (1)H spectra were acquired after first-order shimming was performed. RESULTS: The field maps collected in the three animals were highly reproducible. B(0) dispersion throughout the brain was typically two to three times greater in the supine position than in the sphinx position. Although first-order shimming proved relatively more efficient in the supine position, B(0) dispersion still remained greater in the supine than in the sphinx position. These findings can be explained by the thickness of outer brain tissues. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that the sphinx position is highly favorable in terms of B(0) homogeneity. It should prove useful for NMR exploration of the monkey brain, particularly at high fields where B(0) inhomogeneity associated with susceptibility artifacts is increased.},

This work proposes a methodology based on dynamic acquisition of relaxation time maps to quantify in vivo MRI contrast agent concentration after intra-cerebral injection in rat brain. It was applied to estimate the hindered diffusion in brain tissues of five contrast agents with different hydrodynamic diameters (Dotarem(®) ≈ 1 nm, P846 ≈ 4 nm, P792 ≈ 7 nm, P904 ≈ 22 nm and Gd-based emulsion ≈ 170 nm). In vivo apparent diffusion coefficients were compared with those estimated in an obstacle-free medium to determine brain extracellular space and tortuosity. At a 2 h imaging timescale, all contrast agents except the Gd-based emulsion exhibited significant diffusion through brain tissues, with characteristic times compatible with MR molecular imaging ({\textless}70 min to diffuse between two capillaries). In conclusion, our experiments indicate that MRI contrast agents with sizes up to 22 nm can be used to perform molecular imaging on intra-cerebral biomarkers. Our quantification methodology allows a precise estimation of apparent diffusion coefficients, which is helpful to calibrate optimal timing between contrast agent injection and MRI observation for molecular imaging studies.},

Relaxation times were compared with values from the literature found at lower magnetic fields.
METHODS: (1) H NMR spectra were measured using a LASER localization sequence. T1 - and T2 -weighted spectra were analyzed using LCModel with an original parameterization of the macromolecule baseline.
RESULTS: The T1 relaxation times of 20 metabolites and the T2 relaxation times of 16 singlets and J-coupled metabolites were measured. The mean T1 and T2 relaxation times for metabolites were 1721 ± 237 ms and 148 ± 53 ms, respectively. In addition, we measured the T1 and T2 relaxation times of 4 macromolecule resonance groups, their mean T1 and T2 relaxation times being 690 ± 100 ms and 37 ± 15 ms, respectively. Absolute quantification of 21 metabolites and 4 groups of macromolecule resonances was achieved with Cramer-Rao Lower Bounds below 5\% for Cr, Gln, Glu, GPC, Ins, NAA, PCr, and Tau and below 25\% for the remaining resonances.
CONCLUSION: Comparison of our relaxation times to previously published values suggests a small increase of T1 values and a clear decrease of T2 values between 11.7 and 17.2T.},

A lipoCEST carrying Tm(III)-complexes was conjugated to RGD tripeptide (RGD-lipoCEST), to target integrin α(ν)β(3) receptors involved in tumor angiogenesis and was compared with an unconjugated lipoCEST. Brain tumors were induced in athymic nude mice by intracerebral injection of U87MG cells and were imaged at 7 T after intravenous injection of either of the two contrast agents (n = 12 for each group). Chemical exchange saturation transfer-MSME sequence was applied over 2 h with an average acquisition time interval of 13.5 min. The chemical exchange saturation transfer signal was ∼1\% in the tumor and controlateral regions, and decreased to ∼0.3\% after 2 h; while RGD-lipoCEST signal was ∼1.4\% in the tumor region and persisted for up to 2 h. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a persistent colocalization of RGD-lipoCEST with α(ν)β(3) receptors in the tumor region. These results constitute an encouraging step toward in vivo MRI imaging of tumor angiogenesis using intravenously injected lipoCEST.},

In this work, the potential of (19)F MRI was investigated to detect angiogenesis with α(ν)β(3)-targeted perfluorooctylbromide nanoparticles (PFOB NP) in a U87 glioblastoma mouse model at 7 Tesla. Mice were injected intravenously with targeted or non-targeted NP and (19)F images were immediately acquired for 90 min using a PFOB-dedicated MRI sequence. Mice infused with targeted NP exhibited higher concentrations in tumors than mice of the control group, despite the presence of nonspecific signal originating from the blood. Imaging results were corroborated by histology and fluorescence imaging, suggesting specific binding of targeted NP to α(ν)β(3) integrin. Two other groups of mice were injected 24 h before imaging to allow blood clearance but no significant differences were found between both groups, probably due to a loss of specificity of PFOB NP.

	abstract = {The pathophysiological processes underlying the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the neuronal level are still unclear. Previous research has hinted at metabolic energy deficits and altered sodium homeostasis with impaired neuronal function as a potential metabolic marker relevant for neurotransmission in AD. Using sodium (23Na) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging on an ultra-high-field 7 Tesla MR scanner, we found increased cerebral tissue sodium concentration (TSC) in 17 biomarker-defined AD patients compared to 22 age-matched control subjects in vivo. TSC was highly discriminative between controls and early AD stages and was predictive for cognitive state, and associated with regional tau load assessed with flortaucipir-positron emission tomography as a possible mediator of TSC-associated neurodegeneration. TSC could therefore serve as a non-invasive, stage-dependent, metabolic imaging marker. Setting a focus on cellular metabolism and potentially disturbed interneuronal communication due to energy-dependent altered cell homeostasis could hamper progressive cognitive decline by targeting these processes in future interventions.},

The presence of reactive astrocytes in MS lesions has been described for a long time; however, the role that these cells play in the pathophysiology of MS is still not fully understood. Recently, we used an MS animal model to perform high-throughput sequencing of astrocytes’ transcriptome during disease progression. Our data show that astrocytes isolated from the cerebellum (a brain region typically affected in MS) showed a strong alteration in the genes that encode for proteins related to several metabolic pathways. Specifically, we found a significant increase in glycogen degradation, glycolytic, and TCA cycle enzymes. Together with these alterations, we detected an upregulation of genes that characterize “astrocyte reactivity”. Additionally, at each disease time point we also reconstructed the morphology of cerebellum astrocytes in non-induced controls and in EAE animals, near lesion regions and in the normal-appearing white mater (NAWM). We found that near lesions, astrocytes presented increased length and complexity compared to control astrocytes, while no significant alterations were observed in the NAWM. How these metabolic alterations are linked with disease progression is yet to be uncovered. Herein, we bring to the literature the hypothesis of performing metabolic reprogramming as a novel therapeutic approach in MS.},

              The structural connectivity of animal brains can be revealed using post-mortem diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite the existence of several structural atlases of avian brains, few of them address the bird’s structural connectivity. In this study, a novel atlas of the structural connectivity is proposed for the male Japanese quail (
              Coturnix japonica
              ), aiming at investigating two lines divergent on their emotionality trait: the short tonic immobility (STI) and the long tonic immobility (LTI) lines. The STI line presents a low emotionality trait, while the LTI line expresses a high emotionality trait. 21 male Japanese quail brains from both lines were scanned post-mortem for this study, using a preclinical Bruker 11.7 T MRI scanner. Diffusion-weighted MRI was performed using a 3D segmented echo planar imaging (EPI) pulsed gradient spin-echo (PGSE) sequence with a 200
