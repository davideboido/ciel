In this work, we characterize the evolution of the microvascular flux at different stages of tumor growth in the 9L rat brain tumor model. The absolute quantification of cerebral blood flux is achieved with MRI at 7 T using the flow enhanced signal intensity (FENSI) method. FENSI flux maps were obtained between 5 and 14 days after glioma cell inoculation. Based on cerebral blood flux maps, we highlighted two main stages of tumor growth, below and above 3 mm, presenting distinct flux patterns and vascular properties. No significant difference emerged from the group analysis performed on the data collected at an early developmental stage (tumor size {\textless} 3 mm) when compared with healthy tissue. At a late developmental stage (tumor size {\textgreater} 3 mm), we observed a significant decrease in the cerebral blood flux inside the gliosarcoma (-33\%, p {\textless} 0.01) and compartmentalization of the tumor (p {\textless} 0.05). FENSI flux maps delineated a low-flux tumor core (58 ± 17 μL/min/cm(2) ) and higher vascularized regions around the tumor periphery (85 ± 21 μL/min/cm(2) ). Histology was performed on 11 animals to finely probe the intratumor heterogeneity and microvessel density, and the results were compared with the information derived from FENSI flux maps. The hyper- and hypoperfused tumor regions revealed with FENSI at the late tumor developmental stage correlated well with the ratios of high and low blood vessel density (R(2) = 0.41) and fractional vascular surface (R(2) = 0.67) observed with fluorescence microscopy [cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31) staining].},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to quantitatively determine glycosaminoglycan content in canine articular cartilage.
METHODS: Fifty-four full-thickness cartilage discs were collected from the femorotibial and scapulohumeral joints of three adult dogs immediately following euthanasia. One set of discs from each dog was analysed for glycosaminoglycan content using a colourimetric laboratory assay. The remaining position-matched set of discs from contralateral limbs underwent pre- and post-contrast gadolinium-enhanced MRI, using repeated saturation recovery pulse sequences which were used to generate calculated T1 maps of the cartilage discs. Linear regression analysis was then performed relating delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI T1 calculated signal intensity to the cartilage glycosaminoglycan content normalized to DNA content. Repeatability of triplicate measurements was estimated by calculating the coefficient of variation.
RESULTS: Mean coefficient of variation estimates for the gadolinium-enhanced MRI T1 signal intensity values for nine sampling sites from three dogs ranged from 5.9\% to 7.5\%. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI T1 signal intensity was significantly correlated (p {\textless}0.05) with normalized glycosaminoglycan content in two dogs (r = 0.79, p = 0.011; r = 0.78, p = 0.048), but not in the third dog (r = 0.53, p = 0.071).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI assessment of cartilage may be predictive of glycosaminoglycan content and therefore offer an in vivo assessment of changes in cartilage characteristics over time. Additional studies appear indicated to determine the reliability and clinical applicability of gadolinium-enhanced MRI in detecting changes in cartilage over time.},

The dependencies of the fMRI signal change on the strength of the magnetic field and on different acquisition and sequence parameters were investigated. Artifact-free rat brain images with good resolution in all areas, as well as significant localized activation maps upon forepaw stimulation, were obtained in a single scan using fully refocused SPEN sequences devoid of T2* effects. Our results showed that, besides the normal T2-weighted BOLD contribution that arises in spin-echo sequences, fMRI SPEN signals contain a strong component caused by apparent T1-related effects, demonstrating the potential of such technique for exploring functional activation in rodents and on humans at ultrahigh fields.},

	abstract = {Exploring the pathways of manganese (Mn(2+)) transport in the nervous system becomes of interest as many recent studies use Mn(2+) as a neural tract tracer in mammals. In this study, we performed manganese enhanced MRI (MEMRI) at 17.2 T on the buccal ganglia of Aplysia californica. The main advantage of this model over mammalian systems is that it contains networks of large identified neurons. Using Mn(2+) retrograde transport along selected nerves, we first validated the mapping of motor neurons' axonal projections into peripheral nerves, previously obtained from optical imaging (Morton et al., 1991). This protocol was found not to alter the functional properties of the neuronal network. Second, we compared the Mn(2+) dynamics inside the ganglia in the presence or absence of chemical stimulation. We found that 2h of stimulation with the modulatory transmitter dopamine increased the extent of areas of intermediate signal enhancement caused by manganese accumulation. In the absence of dopamine, an overall decrease of the enhanced areas in favor of non-enhanced areas was found, as a result of natural Mn(2+) washout. This supports the hypothesis that, upon activation, Mn(2+) is released from labeled neurons and captured by other, initially unlabeled, neurons. However, the latter could not be clearly identified due to lack of sensitivity and multiplicity of possible pathways starting from labeled cells. Nonetheless, the Aplysia buccal ganglia remain a well-suited model for attempting to visualize Mn(2+) transport from neuron to neuron upon activation, as well as for studying dopaminergic modulation in a motor network.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sedation agents affect brain hemodynamic and metabolism leading to specific modifications of the cerebral blood oxygenation level. We previously demonstrated that ultra-high field (UHF) MRI detects changes in cortical blood oxygenation following the administration of sedation drugs commonly used in animal research. Here we applied the UHF-MRI method to study clinically relevant sedation drugs for their effects on cortical and subcortical (thalamus, striatum) oxygenation levels.
METHODS: We acquired T2*-weighted images of Sprague-Dawley rat brains at 17.2T in vivo. During each MRI session, rats were first anesthetized with isoflurane, then with a second sedative agent (sevoflurane, propofol, midazolam, medetomidine or ketamine-xylazine) after stopping isoflurane. We computed a T2*-oxygenation-ratio that aimed at estimating cerebral blood oxygenation level for each sedative agent in each region of interest: cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and striatum.
RESULTS: The T2*-oxygenation-ratio was consistent across scan sessions. This ratio was higher with inhalational agents than with intravenous agents. Under sevoflurane and medetomidine, T2*-oxygenation-ratio was homogenous across the brain regions. Intravenous agents (except medetomidine) induced a T2*-oxygenation-ratio imbalance between cortex and subcortical regions: T2*-oxygenation-ratio was higher in the cortex than the subcortical areas under ketamine-xylazine; T2*-oxygenation-ratio was higher in subcortical regions than in the cortex under propofol or midazolam.
CONCLUSION: Preclinical UHF MRI is a powerful method to monitor the changes in cerebral blood oxygenation level induced by sedative agents across brain structures. This approach also allows for a classification of sedative agents based on their differential effects on cerebral blood oxygenation level.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the diffusion time dependency of water diffusion in cortical brain tissue.
METHODS: We have combined an oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE) and a pulse gradient spin echo (PGSE) spin-echo sequence to acquire diffusion-weighted MRI images in vivo in healthy rat brains over a wide range of diffusion times (1.9-29.2 ms) and estimated the parameters of the biexponential and cumulant expansion diffusion MRI signal models. Diffusion images were obtained at 17.2 Tesla with maximum gradient strength of 1000 mT/m allowing 40 b values up to approximately 4000 s/mm(2).
RESULTS: At all diffusion times the log plot of diffusion signal attenuation versus b value was curved, confirming that diffusion is not free, even at very short diffusion times. This suggests that the length scale of obstacles to diffusion must be smaller than the corresponding shortest observed diffusion distance (approximately 1.7 μm). The diffusion MRI signal was also not found in a steady-state, even at our longest diffusion time (29.2 ms), suggesting some degree of segregation of water in pools.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the results showed that the parameters derived from the two diffusion models could not well be related to specific tissue features. More specific models must be developed taking into account diffusion signal behavior at high b values and short diffusion times.},

A three-dimensional diffusion prepared fast imaging with steady-state free precession sequence for MR microscopy was implemented on a 17.2 T imaging system and used to investigate the effect of two biological challenges known to cause cell swelling, exposure to a hypotonic solution or to ouabain, on Aplysia nervous tissue. The ADC was measured inside isolated neuronal soma and in the region of cell bodies of the buccal ganglia. Both challenges resulted in an ADC increase inside isolated neuronal soma (+31 ± 24\% and +30 ± 11\%, respectively) and an ADC decrease at tissue level in the buccal ganglia (-12 ± 5\% and -18 ± 8\%, respectively). A scenario involving a layer of water molecules bound to the inflating cell membrane surface is proposed to reconcile this apparent discrepancy.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0089225},
	abstract = {Recent diffusion MRI studies of stroke in humans and animals have shown that the quantitative parameters characterising the degree of non-Gaussianity of the diffusion process are much more sensitive to ischemic changes than the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) considered so far as the "gold standard". The observed changes exceeded that of the ADC by a remarkable factor of 2 to 3. These studies were based on the novel non-Gaussian methods, such as diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and log-normal distribution function imaging (LNDFI). As shown in our previous work investigating the animal stroke model, a combined analysis using two methods, DKI and LNDFI provides valuable complimentary information. In the present work, we report the application of three non-Gaussian diffusion models to quantify the deviations from the Gaussian behaviour in stroke induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in rat brains: the gamma-distribution function (GDF), the stretched exponential model (SEM), and the biexponential model. The main goal was to compare the sensitivity of various non-Gaussian metrics to ischemic changes and to investigate if a combined application of several models will provide added value in the assessment of stroke. We have shown that two models, GDF and SEM, exhibit a better performance than the conventional method and allow for a significantly enhanced visualization of lesions. Furthermore, we showed that valuable information regarding spatial properties of stroke lesions can be obtained. In particular, we observed a stratified cortex structure in the lesions that were well visible in the maps of the GDF and SEM metrics, but poorly distinguishable in the ADC-maps. Our results provided evidence that cortical layers tend to be differently affected by ischemic processes.},

However, analyses of microdialysate, performed remotely, do not provide real-time monitoring of microdialysate composition. Microdialysate solutions can theoretically be analyzed online inside a preclicinal or clinical MRI scanner using MRS techniques. Due to low NMR sensitivity, acquisitions of real-time NMR spectra on very small solution volumes (μL) with low metabolite concentrations (mM range) represent a major issue. To address this challenge we introduce the approach of combining a microdialysis probe with a custom-built magnetic resonance microprobe that allows for online metabolic analysis (1H and 13C) with high sensitivity under continuous flow conditions. This system is mounted inside an MRI scanner and allows performing simultaneously MRI experiments and rapid MRS metabolic analysis of the microdialysate. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by analyzing extracellular brain cancer cells (glioma) in vitro and brain metabolites in an animal model in vivo. We expect that our approach is readily translatable into clinical settings and can be used for a better and precise understanding of diseases linked to metabolic dysfunction.},

However, reaching high resolutions often requires long acquisition times which can lead to reduced image quality due to sample deterioration and hardware instability. Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques offer the opportunity to significantly reduce the imaging time. The purpose of this work is to test the feasibility of CS acquisitions based on Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA) sampling patterns for high resolution quantitative T1-weighted imaging. Fully encoded and DLA-CS T1-weighted images of Aplysia californica neural tissue were acquired on a 17.2T MRI system. The MR signal corresponding to single, identified neurons was quantified for both versions of the T1 weighted images. For a 50\% undersampling, DLA-CS can accurately quantify signal intensities in T1-weighted acquisitions leading to only 1.37\% differences when compared to the fully encoded data, with minimal impact on image spatial resolution. In addition, we compared the conventional polynomial undersampling scheme with the DLA and showed that, for the data at hand, the latter performs better. Depending on the image signal to noise ratio, higher undersampling ratios can be used to further reduce the acquisition time in MEMRI based functional studies of living tissues.},

The IVIM signals, obtained by removing the diffusion component from the raw MR signal, were fitted to the standard mono-exponential model, a bi-exponential model and the Kennan model. The Akaike information criterion used to find the best model to fit the data demonstrates that, at short diffusion times, the bi-exponential IVIM model is most appropriate.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) is an increasingly popular alternative to standard functional MRI methods in animal studies. The contrast in MEMRI images is based on the accumulation of Mn2+ ions inside neurons, and, since manganese can serve as calcium analogue, this accumulation reflects calcium dynamics providing versatile information about brain neuroarchitecture and functionality. However, despite its use as a functional imaging tool, the exact relationship between the MEMRI signal and neuronal activity remains elusive.
NEW METHOD: In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying Mn2+ accumulation resulting in MEMRI signal enhancement we investigated single neuron responses of isolated Aplysia buccal ganglia subjected to chemical (dopamine) or electrical stimulation of an input nerve (oesophageal nerve). The elicited electrical activity that represents a fictive feeding was recorded with electrophysiological methods and the Mn2+ uptake in individual neurons was evaluated with MEMRI at 17.2T.
RESULTS \& COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We show a positive correlation between bursts of electrical activity and MEMRI signal intensity in identified neurons and demonstrate that the MEMRI signal reflects mainly fast and high membrane depolarization processes such as action potentials, and it is not sensitive to slow and small membrane depolarizations, such as post-synaptic potentials.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Radiation therapy is widely used for the treatment of brain tumors, but it may lead to severe cognitive impairments. Previous studies have shown that ionizing irradiation induces demyelination, blood-brain barrier alterations, and impaired neurogenesis in animal models. Hence, noninvasive and sensitive biomarkers of irradiation injury are needed to investigate these effects in patients and improve radiation therapy protocols.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The heads of 3-month-old male C57BL/6RJ mice (15 control mice and 15 irradiated mice) were exposed to radiation doses of 3 fractions of 5 Gy from a 60Co source with a medical irradiator. A longitudinal study was performed to investigate cranial irradiation-induced (3 fractions of 5 Gy) microstructural tissue alterations using water diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy in different areas of the mouse brain (cortex, thalamus, striatum, olfactory bulbs [OBs], hippocampus, and subventricular zone [SVZ]). In addition to the quantification of standard non-Gaussian diffusion parameters, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC0) and kurtosis (K), we evaluated a new composite diffusion metric, designated the S-index (ie, "signature index").
RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in the S-index in the SVZ from 1 month to 8 months after brain irradiation (P {\textless} .05). An interesting finding was that, along with a decrease in taurine levels (up to -15\% at 2 months, P {\textless} .01), a delayed S-index drop was observed in the OBs from 4 months after irradiation and maintained until the end of our experiment (P {\textless} .0001). These observations suggest that S-index variations revealed the irradiation-induced decline of neurogenesis that was further confirmed by a decrease in neural stem cells in the SVZ and in newborn neurons in the OBs of irradiated animals.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, especially through the S-index approach, is a relevant imaging modality to monitor brain irradiation injury and probe microstructural changes underlying irradiation-induced cognitive deficits.},

Still, this approach remains indirect and may fail in situations interfering with the neurovascular coupling mechanisms (drugs, anesthesia). Here we establish that water molecular diffusion is directly modulated by underlying neuronal activity using a rat forepaw stimulation model under different conditions of neuronal stimulation and neurovascular coupling. Under nitroprusside infusion, a neurovascular-coupling inhibitor, the diffusion response and local field potentials were maintained, whereas the hemodynamic response was abolished. As diffusion MRI reflects interactions of water molecules with obstacles (e.g., cell membranes), the observed changes point to a dynamic modulation of the neural tissue structure upon activation, which remains to be investigated. These findings represent a significant shift in concept from the current electrochemical and neurovascular coupling principles used for brain imaging, and open unique avenues to investigate mechanisms underlying brain function.},

The gut administration of glucose induces a preference for flavored water which is paired with the intragastric infusion of glucose. However, a comparison of the brain response to the gut glucose and saccharin stimuli still remains to be demonstrated. Here, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal response to gut glucose and saccharin in the brain of conscious rats. Glucose induced a positive signal increase in the amygdala and nucleus accumben, both of which receive dopaminergic input from the ventral tegmental area. In contrast, saccharin administration did not activate these areas. Both glucose and saccharin increased the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal intensity in the insular cortex and the nucleus of the solitary tract. These results show that there were significant differences between postingestive glucose and saccharin-induced increases in the blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in rats. Together with previous findings, these results suggest distinct activation patterns in the brain for both glucose and saccharin, which is partially due to different changes of internal signals, including the blood glucose and insulin levels.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Our aim was to investigate the pertinence of diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters obtained at 17.2 T in a 9L glioma rat brain tumor model to evaluate tumor tissue characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local animal ethics advisory committee approved this study. 9L glioma cells were injected intracerebrally to 14 Fischer rats. The animals were imaged at 7 or 12 days after implantation on a 17.2-T MRI scanner, using 72 different b values (2-3025 s/mm(2)). The signal attenuation, S/So, was fitted using a kurtosis diffusion model (ADCo and K) and a biexponential diffusion model (fractions ffast and fslow and diffusion coefficients Dfast and Dslow) using b values greater than 300 s/mm(2). To bridge the 2 models, an average diffusion coefficient {\textless}D{\textgreater} and a biexponential index were estimated from the biexponential model as ADCo and K equivalents, respectively. Intravoxel incoherent motion perfusion-related parameters were obtained from the residual signal at low b values, after the diffusion component has been removed. Diffusion and perfusion maps were generated for each fitted parameter on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and regions of interest were drawn in the tumor and contralateral side to retrieve diffusion and perfusion parameters. All rats were killed and cellularity and vascularity were quantitatively assessed using histology for comparison with diffusion and perfusion parameters.
RESULTS: Intravoxel incoherent motion maps clearly highlighted tumor areas as generally heterogeneous, as confirmed by histology. For diffusion parameters, ADCo and {\textless}D{\textgreater} were not significantly different between the tumor and contralateral side, whereas K in the tumor was significantly higher than in contralateral basal ganglia (P {\textless} 0.0001), as well as biexponential index (P {\textless} 0.001). ADCo and {\textless}D{\textgreater} in the tumor at day 7 were significantly higher than at day 12 (P {\textless} 0.01 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). fIVIM in the tumor from the kurtosis diffusion model was significantly higher than in contralateral basal ganglia (P {\textless} 0.001). fIVIM in the tumor at day 7 was significantly higher than in the tumor at day 12 (P {\textless} 0.0001). There was no significant difference for D* between the tumor and contralateral side (P = 0.06). A significant negative correlation was found between tumor vascularity and fIVIM (P {\textless} 0.05) as well as between tumor cell count and {\textless}D{\textgreater} (P {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Quantitative non-Gaussian diffusion and perfusion MRI can provide valuable information on microvasculature and tissue structure to improve characterization of brain tumors.},

Here, using awake functional magnetic resonance imaging and fiber tracking, we analyzed functional brain connectivity during the association of tastes and visceral illness. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal significantly increased in the PL after tastant and lithium chloride (LiCl) infusions. The BOLD signal in the PL significantly correlated with those in the amygdala and agranular insular cortex (IC), which we found were also structurally connected to the PL by fiber tracking. To precisely examine these data, we then performed double immunofluorescence with a neuronal activity marker (c-Fos) and an inhibitory neuron marker (GAD67) combined with a fluorescent retrograde tracer in the PL. During CTA learning, we found an increase in the activity of excitatory neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) or agranular IC that project to the PL. Taken together, these findings clearly identify a role of synchronized PL, agranular IC, and BLA activity in CTA learning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in mice is typically performed under anesthesia due to difficulties in holding the head of awake mice stably with a conventional three-point fixation method that uses a tooth-bar and earplugs. Although some studies have succeeded in fMRI in awake mice by attaching a head-post on the skull, this cannot be applied to fMRI using a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cryogenic MRI-detector, CryoProbe, because it covers the head of a mouse closely.
NEW METHOD: We developed head-fixation implements for awake mice that are applicable to fMRI using CryoProbe.
RESULTS: A head-bar was surgically attached to the skull of a mouse that was then habituated to a mock fMRI-environment, two hours/day for eight days with physiological examinations of body-weight, fecal weight, electromyogram (EMG), and electrocardiogram. EMG power decreased with just one day of habituation, whereas heart rate decreased after at least seven days of habituation. Estimated head motions of awake mice during fMRI were significantly smaller than a voxel size. Unexpectedly, temporal SNR of fMRI signals for awake mice was higher than that for anesthetized mice held by a conventional method. Functional connectivity in the brain of both anesthetized and awake mice showed bilateral and unilateral networks. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): fMRI using CryoProbe had been performed on anesthetized mice previously. Our method does not use anesthetics during habituation or fMRI.
CONCLUSION: Our method would be beneficial for translational research using fMRI in mice and humans because human fMRI is typically performed without anesthetics.},

We investigated the effects of low-dose alcohol (0.02 g/100 ml blood alcohol concentration) and placebo effects on subjective risk perception and subjective valuation of uncertain gain and loss in females and males. Participants in the control group and the placebo group were served alcohol-free, wine-flavored beverage and participants of alcohol group were served wine (14\% alcohol). The placebo group was not informed that the drink was not alcohol but the control group was informed. Then paper-pencil tasks for subjective risk perception and valuation of gain or loss were performed 45 min after drinking the beverage. The participants were asked to draw the line on a 180 mm scale for each question. The placebo effects as well as the low-dose alcohol effects were observed in subjective valuations of gain or loss. Except for effect of beverages, a gender difference was also observed for subjective likelihood. The females estimated a low-probability loss as more likely and estimated a high-probability gain as less likely than did the males. From the Stevens' law fitting analysis, the placebo, not alcohol, significantly induced the psychophysical effect of the subjective valuation of gain or loss. These results indicate that the psychological effects of expectancy of alcohol (placebo) could be a major factor in changing the subjective valuation of gain or loss over the pharmacological effects of a small amount of alcohol (like a glass of wine). Furthermore, these results also indicate that gender differences should be taken into account when investigating pharmacological or psychological effect on decision-making.},

The local field potential (LFP) in the somatosensory cortex and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were also investigated. Isoflurane induced inverted U-shaped dose-dependent change in BOLD signal in large vessels and tissue regions: BOLD signal under 2.0\% and 2.5\% isoflurane significantly increased from the maintenance dose (1.5\%) and that under 3.0\% was similar to maintenance dose. Remarkably, BOLD signal increase in tissue regions under 2.5\% was significantly smaller than that in large vessels. The MAP decreased monotonically due to the dose of isoflurane and the LFP was strongly suppressed under high dose (2.5\% and 3.0\%).

Hence, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI, which relies on neurovascular coupling, might not be reliable to reflect alcohol-induced neuronal responses. Recently, diffusion fMRI has been shown to be more sensitive to neural activity than BOLD fMRI even when neurovascular coupling is disrupted. Especially, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is sensitive to changes occurring in the cellular tissue structure upon activation. In the present study, we compared BOLD fMRI signals, ADC, and local field potentials (LFPs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) following injection of an ethanol solution (0.4 g/kg body weight) in rats under medetomidine anesthesia. An increase in the gamma oscillation power of LFP and an ADC decrease were observed 5 min after the injection of EtOH. The BOLD signals showed a negative slow drift, similar to mean arterial pressure with a peak approximately 10 min after the injection. These results confirm that DfMRI can be a better marker of the neuronal activity than BOLD fMRI, especially when the brain hemodynamic status is changed by vasoactive drugs such as ethanol.},

Here, we show that the water apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) derived from DfMRI increased in specific rat brain regions under anesthetic conditions, reflecting the decreased neuronal activity observed with local field potentials (LFPs), especially in regions involved in wakefulness. In contrast, BOLD signals showed nonspecific changes, reflecting systemic effects of the anesthesia on overall brain hemodynamics status. Electrical stimulation of the central medial thalamus nucleus (CM) exhibiting this anesthesia-induced ADC increase led the animals to transiently wake up. Infusion in the CM of furosemide, a specific neuronal swelling blocker, led the ADC to increase further locally, although LFP activity remained unchanged, and increased the current threshold awakening the animals under CM electrical stimulation. Oppositely, induction of cell swelling in the CM through infusion of a hypotonic solution (-80 milliosmole [mOsm] artificial cerebrospinal fluid [aCSF]) led to a local ADC decrease and a lower current threshold to wake up the animals. Strikingly, the local ADC changes produced by blocking or enhancing cell swelling in the CM were also mirrored remotely in areas functionally connected to the CM, such as the cingulate and somatosensory cortex. Together, those results strongly suggest that neuronal swelling is a significant mechanism underlying DfMRI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Focused ultrasound combined with microbubble injection is capable of locally and transiently enhancing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables to plan, monitor, and characterize the BBB disruption. Being able to precisely and remotely control the permeabilization location is of great interest to perform reproducible drug delivery protocols.
METHODS: In this study, we developed an MR-guided motorized focused ultrasound (FUS) system allowing the transducer displacement within preclinical MRI scanners, coupled with real-time transfer and reconstruction of MRI images, to help ultrasound guidance. Capabilities of this new device to deliver large molecules to the brain on either single locations or along arbitrary trajectories were characterized in vivo on healthy rats and mice using 1.5 MHz ultrasound sonications combined with microbubble injection. The efficacy of BBB permeabilization was assessed by injecting a gadolinium-based MR contrast agent that does not cross the intact BBB.
RESULTS: The compact motorized FUS system developed in this work fits into the 9-cm inner diameter of the gradient insert installed on our 7-T preclinical MRI scanners. MR images acquired after contrast agent injection confirmed that this device can be used to enhance BBB permeability along remotely controlled spatial trajectories of the FUS beam in both rats and mice. The two-axis motor stage enables reaching any region of interest in the rodent brain. The positioning error when targeting the same anatomical location on different animals was estimated to be smaller than 0.5 mm. Finally, this device was demonstrated to be useful for testing BBB opening at various acoustic pressures (0.2, 0.4, 0.7, and 0.9 MPa) in the same animal and during one single ultrasound session.
CONCLUSIONS: Our system offers the unique possibility to move the transducer within a high magnetic field preclinical MRI scanner, thus enabling the delivery of large molecules to virtually any rodent brain area in a non-invasive manner. It results in time-saving and reproducibility and could be used to either deliver drugs over large parts of the brain or test different acoustic conditions on the same animal during the same session, therefore reducing physiological variability.},

	abstract = {Cognitive theories of numerical representation suggest that understanding of numerical quantities is driven by a magnitude representation associated with the intraparietal sulcus and possibly under genetic control. The aim of this study was to investigate, using fMRI and structural imaging, the interaction between the abnormal development of numerical representation in an X-linked condition, Turner syndrome (TS), and the development of the intraparietal sulcus. fMRI during exact and approximate calculation in TS showed an abnormal modulation of intraparietal activations as a function of number size. Morphological analysis revealed an abnormal length, depth, and sulcal geometry of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting an important disorganization of this region in TS. Thus, a genetic form of developmental dyscalculia can be related to both functional and structural anomalies of the right intraparietal sulcus, suggesting a crucial role of this region in the development of arithmetic abilities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing surgical resection of medial frontal lesions may present transient postoperative speech disorders that remain largely unpredictable. OBJECTIVE: To relate the occurrence of this speech deficit to the specific surgical lesion of the supplementary motor area (SMA) involved during language tasks using fMRI. METHODS: Twelve patients were studied using a verbal fluency task before resection of a low-grade glioma of the medial frontal lobe and compared with six healthy subjects. Pre- and postoperative MR variables including the hemispheric dominance for language, the extent of SMA removal, and the volume of resection were compared to the clinical outcome. RESULTS: Following surgery, 6 of 12 patients presented speech disorders. The deficit was similar across patients, consisting of a global reduction in spontaneous speech, ranging from a complete mutism to a less severe speech reduction, which recovered within a few weeks or months. The occurrence of the deficit was related to the resection of the activation in the SMA of the dominant hemisphere for language (p {\textless} 0.01). Increased activation in the SMA of the healthy hemisphere on the preoperative fMRI was observed in patients with postoperative speech deficit. CONCLUSIONS: fMRI is able to identify the area at risk in the SMA, of which resection is related to the occurrence of characteristic transient postoperative speech disorders. Increased SMA activation in the healthy hemisphere suggested that a plastic change of SMA function occurred in these patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether the blood flow abnormalities frequently associated with arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) can alter functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation of language lateralization and whether reorganization of language function occurs in patients with brain AVMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with left-hemisphere brain AVMs and 10 age-matched control subjects were examined with 1.5-T blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MR imaging. Verbal fluency, sentence repetition, and story listening tasks were performed. The functional MR imaging laterality index in the frontal and temporal lobes was defined as the (L - R)/(L + R) ratio, where L and R are the numbers of activated pixels in the left and right hemispheres, respectively. Statistical analyses were performed with Wilcoxon signed rank, Fisher exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Control subjects had left-sided language dominance, although symmetric pixel counts were observed in the frontal lobes in two subjects and in the temporal lobes in one subject. Six patients had left-sided language dominance similar to that observed in control subjects. Five of these patients had AVMs outside frontal or temporal language areas, without flow abnormalities. Five patients had abnormally right-sided asymmetric indexes (below mean control subject value - 2 SDs), which suggested language reorganization (P {\textless}.05). Results of Wada examination and/or postembolization functional MR imaging performed in two of these patients showed that the abnormal laterality indexes were at least partly due to severe flow abnormalities that impaired detection of BOLD MR imaging signal intensity. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that flow abnormalities may interfere with language lateralization assessment with functional MR imaging.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: White matter lesions in cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) are underlaid by severe ultrastructural changes of the arteriolar wall. Although chronic ischemia is presumed to cause the tissue lesions, the pattern of perfusion abnormalities and hemodynamic reserve in CADASIL, particularly within the white matter, remains unknown. METHODS: We used the MRI bolus tracking method in 15 symptomatic patients with CADASIL (5 with dementia) and 10 age-matched control subjects before and 20 minutes after the intravenous injection of acetazolamide (ACZ, 17 mg/kg). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT) were calculated both in the cortex and in the white matter according to the singular value decomposition technique. Perfusion parameters were obtained in regions of hyperintensities and within the normal-appearing white matter as observed on T2-weighted images. Analysis was performed with both absolute and relative (region/whole brain) values. RESULTS: A significant reduction in absolute and relative CBF and CBV was found within areas of T2 hyperintensities in white matter in the absence of significant variations of MTT. This reduction was more severe in demented than in nondemented patients. No significant change in absolute CBF and CBV values was observed in the cortex of patients with CADASIL. A decrease in relative CBF and CBV values was detected in the occipital cortex. After ACZ administration, CBF and CBV increased significantly in both the cortex and white matter of affected subjects, but the increase in absolute CBF was lower within areas of increased signal on T2-weighted images in patients than in the white matter of control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: In CADASIL, both basal perfusion and hemodynamic reserve are decreased in areas of T2 hyperintensities in the white matter. This hypoperfusion appears to be related to the clinical severity. The significant effect of ACZ on CBF and CBV suggests that cerebral perfusion might be increased using pharmacological vasodilation in CADASIL.},

	issn = {0039-2499 (Print)},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CADASIL is a newly recognized cause of subcortical ischemic strokes that progressively leads to dementia associated with pseudobulbar palsy and severe motor disability. This deleterious progression and the severity of clinical presentation are widely variable among affected subjects. The exact role played by MRI white-matter abnormalities, a hallmark of the disease, in the severity of the clinical phenotype remains poorly understood. METHODS: To address this issue, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a new MRI technique highly sensitive to white-matter microstructural changes, in 16 symptomatic patients and 10 age-matched controls. Mean diffusivity and anisotropy of diffusion were measured within hyperintensities identified on T2-weighted images (T2WI) and outside these lesions on 4 slices at the level of centrum semiovale. RESULTS: We found a 60\% increase of water mean diffusivity and a parallel loss of diffusion anisotropy in hyperintensities identified on T2WI. The same pattern of diffusion changes, but of lesser intensity, was found in the normal-appearing white matter on T2WI. Mean diffusivity in regions with increased signal on T2WI was higher in patients with severe clinical disability compared with those with no or mild deficit (1.33+/-0.11 versus 1.13+/-0.11 10(-3) mm(2)/s, P{\textless}0.01). Furthermore, diffusion measured within T2 hyperintensities correlated with both the Mini-Mental State Examination and Rankin scale scores. In patients with a severe clinical status, the increase of water diffusion in these regions exceeded 70\% in comparison with values obtained in the normal white matter in control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that DTI is able to detect important ultrastructural changes in regions with increased signal on T2WI and within the normal-appearing white matter in CADASIL. The diffusion changes might be related to both neuronal loss and demyelination. The degree of the underlying ultrastructural alterations is related to the severity of the clinical status with a possible threshold level of white-matter damage above which severe neurological impairment may occur in this disease. DTI appears to be a promising technique for monitoring disease progression in CADASIL.},

The presuppression sequence includes a spatial suppression sequence to selectively saturate slices that intersect the plane selected by the STE sequence in order to define a boundary for the volume of interest, and this spatial suppression sequence is substantially repeated during the TM interval of the STE sequence. Spectroscopic imaging data is acquired by an oversampled echo planar spatial-spectral imaging sequence in which the gradient reversal frequency is a integer factor of n greater than the gradient reversal frequency required to sample the spectral width.

	volume = {228},
	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {The pathophysiology of tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic stimulation, is largely unknown, although several lines of research implicate long-term neuroplastic loss of inhibition. The evidence to date suggests that the neuroplastic alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain structures. The present study used manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MEMRI) to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic acoustic-exposure-induced tinnitus. Manganese, an activity-dependent paramagnetic contrast agent, accumulates in active neurons through voltage-gated calcium channels, primarily at synapses, and serves as both a structural and functional indicator. Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external tinnitus-like sound, and from tinnitus subjects treated with vigabatrin, a GABA agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in rats. MEMRI indicated: (1) In rats with evidence of tinnitus, activity was generally elevated in the auditory brainstem, with significant elevation in the cerebellar paraflocculus, the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus, and the inferior colliculus; in general forebrain structures showed decreased activity, although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem activity; (2) in normal rats exposed to a tinnitus-like sound, a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was evident, with the notable exception of the paraflocculus, where artificial tinnitus had no effect and (3) vigabatrin, decreased brainstem activity to control levels, in rats with prior evidence of tinnitus, and decreased forebrain activity to below control levels. It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the paraflocculus that may be unique to tinnitus.},

	abstract = {Functional neuroimaging has emerged as an important approach to study the brain and the mind. Surprisingly, although they are based on radically different physical approaches both positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) make brain activation imaging possible through measurements involving water molecules. So far, PET and MRI functional imaging have relied on the principle that neuronal activation and blood flow are coupled through metabolism. However, a new paradigm has emerged to look at brain activity through the observation with MRI of the molecular diffusion of water. In contrast with the former approaches diffusion MRI has the potential to reveal changes in the intrinsic water physical properties during brain activation, which could be more intimately linked to the neuronal activation mechanisms and lead to an improved spatial and temporal resolution. However, this link has yet to be fully confirmed and understood. To shed light on the possible relationship between water and brain activation, this introductory paper reviews the most recent data on the physical properties of water and on the status of water in biological tissues, and evaluates their relevance to brain diffusion MRI. The biophysical mechanisms of brain activation are then reassessed to reveal their intimacy with the physical properties of water, which may come to be regarded as the 'molecule of the mind'.},

The observed changes in water diffusion likely reflect early biophysical events that take place in the activated cells, such as cell swelling and membrane expansion.

	abstract = {The human infant is particularly immature at birth and brain maturation, with the myelination of white matter fibers, is protracted until adulthood. Diffusion tensor imaging offers the possibility to describe non invasively the fascicles spatial organization at an early stage and to follow the cerebral maturation with quantitative parameters that might be correlated with behavioral development. Here, we assessed the feasibility to study the organization and maturation of major white matter bundles in eighteen 1- to 4-month-old healthy infants, using a specific acquisition protocol customized to the immature brain (with 15 orientations of the diffusion gradients and a 700 s mm(-2)b factor). We were able to track most of the main fascicles described at later ages despite the low anisotropy of the infant white matter, using the FACT algorithm. This mapping allows us to propose a new method of quantification based on reconstructed tracts, split between specific regions, which should be more sensitive to specific changes in a bundle than the conventional approach, based on regions-of-interest. We observed variations in fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity over the considered developmental period in most bundles (corpus callosum, cerebellar peduncles, cortico-spinal tract, spino-thalamic tract, capsules, radiations, longitudinal and uncinate fascicles, cingulum). The results are in good agreement with the known stages of white matter maturation and myelination, and the proposed approach might provide important insights on brain development.},

We observed considerable overlap in the neural substrates of the three comparison tasks. Interestingly, the amount of overlap predicted the amount of cross-dimensional interference: in both behavior and fMRI, number interfered with size, and size with luminance, but number did not interfere with luminance. The results suggest that during comparative judgments, the relevant continuous quantities are represented in distributed and overlapping neural populations, with number and size engaging a common parietal spatial code, while size and luminance engage shared occipito-temporal perceptual representations.},

	volume = {360},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to study the variation of brain functional connectivity networks with respect to experimental conditions in fMRI data. It is related to the psychophysiological interaction technique introduced by Friston et al. and extends to networks of correlation modulation (CM networks). Extended networks containing several dozens of nodes are determined in which the links correspond to consistent correlation modulation across subjects. In addition, we assess inter-subject variability and determine networks in which the condition-dependent functional interactions can be explained by a subject-dependent variable. We applied the technique to data from a study on syntactical production in bilinguals and analysed functional interactions differentially across tasks (word reading or sentence production) and across languages. We find an extended network of consistent functional interaction modulation across tasks, whereas the network comparing languages shows fewer links. Interestingly, there is evidence for a specific network in which the differences in functional interaction across subjects can be explained by differences in the subjects' syntactical proficiency. Specifically, we find that regions, including ones that have previously been shown to be involved in syntax and in language production, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, putamen, insula, precentral gyrus, as well as the supplementary motor area, are more functionally linked during sentence production in the second, compared with the first, language in syntactically more proficient bilinguals than in syntactically less proficient ones. Our approach extends conventional activation analyses to the notion of networks, emphasizing functional interactions between regions independently of whether or not they are activated. On the one hand, it gives rise to testable hypotheses and allows an interpretation of the results in terms of the previous literature, and on the other hand, it provides a basis for studying the structure of functional interactions as a whole, and hence represents a further step towards the notion of large-scale networks in functional imaging.},

	abstract = {Human functional MRI studies frequently reveal the joint activation of parietal and of lateral and mesial frontal areas during various cognitive tasks. To analyze the geometrical organization of those networks, we used an automatized clustering algorithm that parcels out sets of areas based on their similar profile of task-related activations or deactivations. This algorithm allowed us to reanalyze published fMRI data (Simon, O., Mangin, J.F., Cohen, L., Le Bihan, D., Dehaene, S., 2002. Topographical layout of hand, eye, calculation, and language-related areas in the human parietal lobe. Neuron 33, 475-487) and to reproduce the previously observed geometrical organization of activations for saccades, attention, grasping, pointing, calculation, and language processing in the parietal lobe. Further, we show that this organization extends to lateral and mesial prefrontal regions. Relative to the parietal lobe, the prefrontal functional geometry is characterized by a partially symmetrical anteroposterior ordering of activations, a decreased representation of effector-specific tasks, and a greater emphasis on higher cognitive functions of attention, higher-order spatial representation, calculation, and language. Anatomically, our results in humans are closely homologous to the known connectivity of parietal and frontal regions in the macaque monkey.},

We used both psychophysics and neuroimaging to examine whether a similar neural coding scheme is present in humans. When participants viewed sets of items with a variable number, the bilateral intraparietal sulci responded selectively to number change. Functionally, the shape of this response indicates that humans, like other animal species, encode approximate number on a compressed internal scale. Anatomically, the intraparietal site coding for number in humans is compatible with that observed in macaque monkeys. Our results therefore suggest an evolutionary basis for human elementary arithmetic.},

	abstract = {How are word recognition circuits organized in the left temporal lobe? We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to dissect cortical word-processing circuits using three diagnostic criteria: the capacity of an area (1) to respond to words in a single modality (visual or auditory) or in both modalities, (2) to modulate its response in a top-down manner as a function of the graphemic or phonemic emphasis of the task, and (3) to show repetition suppression in response to the conscious repetition of the target word within the same sensory modality or across different modalities. The results clarify the organization of visual and auditory word-processing streams. In particular, the visual word form area (VWFA) in the left occipitotemporal sulcus appears strictly as a visual unimodal area. It is, however, bordered by a second lateral inferotemporal area which is multimodal [lateral inferotemporal multimodal area (LIMA)]. Both areas might have been confounded in past work. Our results also suggest a possible homolog of the VWFA in the auditory stream, the auditory word form area, located in the left anterior superior temporal sulcus.},

However, chronometric measures are often ambiguous in separating parallel and serial processes. We have used the activity of attention-related regions of the human brain, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, to separate parallel from serial processes at the single-trial level in a visual quantification task. In this task, some have suggested the deployment of two qualitatively different processes, a fast parallel 'subitizing' for sets of one, two or three objects and a slow serial counting for larger sets. Our results indicate that attention-related regions of the posterior parietal and frontal cortices show a sudden increase in activity only from numerosity four onwards, confirming the parallel-serial dichotomy of subitizing and counting. Moreover, using the presence or absence of attentional shifts, as inferred from the activation of posterior parietal regions, we successfully predict whether, on a given trial, subjects deployed a serial exploration of the display or a parallel apprehension. Beyond the subitizing/counting debate, this approach may prove useful to probe the attentional demands of other cognitive tasks.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence has suggested that the human occipitotemporal region comprises several subregions, each sensitive to a distinct processing level of visual words. To further explore the functional architecture of visual word recognition, we employed a subliminal priming method with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during semantic judgments of words presented in two different Japanese scripts, Kanji and Kana. Each target word was preceded by a subliminal presentation of either the same or a different word, and in the same or a different script. Behaviorally, word repetition produced significant priming regardless of whether the words were presented in the same or different script. At the neural level, this cross-script priming was associated with repetition suppression in the left inferior temporal cortex anterior and dorsal to the visual word form area hypothesized for alphabetical writing systems, suggesting that cross-script convergence occurred at a semantic level. fMRI also evidenced a shared visual occipito-temporal activation for words in the two scripts, with slightly more mesial and right-predominant activation for Kanji and with greater occipital activation for Kana. These results thus allow us to separate script-specific and script-independent regions in the posterior temporal lobe, while demonstrating that both can be activated subliminally.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate this hypothesis with two categories of words, numerals, and body parts, for which the existence of distinct category-specific areas is debated in neuropsychology. Across two experiments, one with a blocked design and the other with an event-related design, a reproducible set of left-hemispheric parietal and prefrontal areas showed greater activation during the manipulation of topographical knowledge about body parts and a right-hemispheric parietal network during the manipulation of numerical quantities. These results complement the existing neuropsychological and brain-imaging literature by suggesting that within the extensive network of bilateral parietal regions active during both number and body-part processing, a subset shows category-specific responses independent of the language and modality of presentation.},

When subjects engage in an overt semantic comparison task with a clearly visible target numeral, measures of covert motor activity indicate that they also unconsciously apply the task instructions to an unseen masked numeral.

In this study, we aimed to provide new in vivo structural markers of hemispheric asymmetries in infants from 1 to 4 months of age, with diffusion tensor imaging. We used 3 complementary analysis methods based on local diffusion indices and spatial localizations of tracts. After a prospective approach over the whole brain, we demonstrated early leftward asymmetries in the arcuate fasciculus and in the cortico-spinal tract.

	abstract = {A new pulse technique for counteracting RF inhomogeneity at high fields is reported. The pulses make use of the detailed knowledge of the voxels' B(1) and B(0) amplitude 2D histogram to generate, through an optimization procedure, gates where the flip angle is made uniform. Although most approaches to date require the use of parallel transmission, this method does not and therefore offers several advantages. The data necessary for the algorithm to determine an irradiation scheme requires only one transmit B(1) along with a B(0) inhomogeneity measurement. The use of a B(1) and B(0) amplitude 2D histogram instead of their spatial distribution also decreases substantially the complexity of the optimization problem, allowing the algorithm to find an RF solution in less than 30 s. Finally, the optimization procedure is based on an exact calculation and does not use any linear approximation. In this article, the theory behind the method in addition to spoiled gradient echo experimental data at 3T for 3D brain imaging are reported. The images obtained yield a reduction of the standard deviation of the sine of the flip angle by a factor of up to 15 around the desired value, compared to when a standard square pulse calibrated by the scanner is used.},

In this work we introduce a flow-based functional imaging method. The method, called flow enhancement of signal intensity (FENSI), is an extension of the diffusion enhancement of signal and resolution (DESIRE) method from MR microscopy. The FENSI method offers a localized flow-weighted signal across a very thin slice (0.4 mm in this study) that provides a signal enhancement that is dependent on the velocity and direction of the flow. The FENSI method was implemented on a human 3 T system and applied to a blocked visual cognitive task. Activation maps showed good localization and the measured signal changes of around 10{\textbackslash}\% were in good agreement with the predicted enhancements.},

The implication of white matter pathways in this propagation has not been investigated. We compared diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements along the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a major tract connecting the frontal and temporal lobes, in patients and controls. Ten right-handed patients referred for intractable TLE due to a right HS were investigated on a 1.5-T MR scanner including a DTI sequence. All patients had interictal fluorodeoxyglucose PET showing an ipsilateral temporal hypometabolism associated with insular and frontal or perisylvian hypometabolism. The controls consisted of ten right-handed healthy subjects. UF fiber tracking was performed, and its fractional anisotropy (FA) values were compared between patients and controls, separately for the right and left UF. The left-minus-right FA UF asymmetry index was computed to test for intergroup differences. Asymmetries were found in the control group with right-greater-than-left FA. This asymmetrical pattern was lost in the patient group. Right FA values were lower in patients with right HS versus controls. Although preliminary, these findings may be related to the preferential pathway of seizure spread from the mesial temporal lobe to frontal and insulo-perisylvian areas.},

	abstract = {Among the astonishing Einstein's papers from 1905, there is one which unexpectedly gave birth to a powerful method to explore the brain. Molecular diffusion was explained by Einstein on the basis of the random translational motion of molecules which results from their thermal energy. In the mid 1980s it was shown that water diffusion in the brain could be imaged using MRI. During their random displacements water molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale, interacting with cell membranes and, thus, providing unique information on the functional architecture of tissues. A dramatic application of diffusion MRI has been brain ischemia, following the discovery that water diffusion drops immediately after the onset of an ischemic event, when brain cells undergo swelling through cytotoxic edema. On the other hand, water diffusion is anisotropic in white matter, because axon membranes limit molecular movement perpendicularly to the fibers. This feature can be exploited to map out the orientation in space of the white matter tracks and image brain connections. More recently, it has been shown that diffusion MRI could accurately detect cortical activation. As the diffusion response precedes by several seconds the hemodynamic response captured by BOLD fMRI, it has been suggested that water diffusion could reflect early neuronal events, such as the transient swelling of activated cortical cells. If confirmed, this discovery will represent a significant breakthrough, allowing non invasive access to a direct physiological marker of brain activation. This approach will bridge the gap between invasive optical imaging techniques in neuronal cell cultures, and current functional neuroimaging approaches in humans, which are based on indirect and remote blood flow changes.},

The repetition of words during semantic categorization produced activation reduction in the left middle temporal gyrus previously associated with semantic-level representation and dorsal premotor cortex. By contrast, reading aloud produced repetition enhancement in the left inferior parietal lobe associated with print-to-sound conversion and ventral premotor cortex. Analyses of effective connectivity revealed that the task set for reading generated reciprocal excitatory connections between the left inferior parietal and superior temporal regions, reflecting the audiovisual integration required for vocalization, whereas categorization did not produce such backward projection to posterior regions. Thus, masked repetition priming involves two distinct components in the task-specific neural streams, one in the parietotemporal cortex for task-specific word processing and the other in the premotor cortex for behavioral response preparation. The top-down influence of task sets further changes the directions of the unconscious priming in the entire cerebral circuitry for reading.},

The observation of these movements thus provides valuable information on the structure and the geometric organization of tissues. The most successful application of diffusion MRI has been in brain ischemia, following the discovery that water diffusion drops at a very early stage of the ischemic event. Diffusion MRI provides some patients with the opportunity to receive suitable treatment at a very acute stage when brain tissue might still be salvageable. On the other hand, diffusion is modulated by the spatial orientation of large bundles of myelinated axons running in parallel through in brain white matter. This feature can be exploited to map out the orientation in space of the white matter tracks and to visualize the connections between different parts of the brain on an individual basis. Furthermore, recent data suggest that diffusion MRI may also be used to visualize rapid dynamic tissue changes, such as neuronal swelling, associated with cortical activation, offering a new and direct approach to brain functional imaging.},

It was applied to estimate the hindered diffusion in brain tissues of five contrast agents with different hydrodynamic diameters (Dotarem(®) ≈ 1 nm, P846 ≈ 4 nm, P792 ≈ 7 nm, P904 ≈ 22 nm and Gd-based emulsion ≈ 170 nm). In vivo apparent diffusion coefficients were compared with those estimated in an obstacle-free medium to determine brain extracellular space and tortuosity. At a 2 h imaging timescale, all contrast agents except the Gd-based emulsion exhibited significant diffusion through brain tissues, with characteristic times compatible with MR molecular imaging ({\textless}70 min to diffuse between two capillaries). In conclusion, our experiments indicate that MRI contrast agents with sizes up to 22 nm can be used to perform molecular imaging on intra-cerebral biomarkers. Our quantification methodology allows a precise estimation of apparent diffusion coefficients, which is helpful to calibrate optimal timing between contrast agent injection and MRI observation for molecular imaging studies.},

A lipoCEST carrying Tm(III)-complexes was conjugated to RGD tripeptide (RGD-lipoCEST), to target integrin α(ν)β(3) receptors involved in tumor angiogenesis and was compared with an unconjugated lipoCEST. Brain tumors were induced in athymic nude mice by intracerebral injection of U87MG cells and were imaged at 7 T after intravenous injection of either of the two contrast agents (n = 12 for each group). Chemical exchange saturation transfer-MSME sequence was applied over 2 h with an average acquisition time interval of 13.5 min. The chemical exchange saturation transfer signal was ∼1\% in the tumor and controlateral regions, and decreased to ∼0.3\% after 2 h; while RGD-lipoCEST signal was ∼1.4\% in the tumor region and persisted for up to 2 h. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a persistent colocalization of RGD-lipoCEST with α(ν)β(3) receptors in the tumor region.

Mice were injected intravenously with targeted or non-targeted NP and (19)F images were immediately acquired for 90 min using a PFOB-dedicated MRI sequence. Mice infused with targeted NP exhibited higher concentrations in tumors than mice of the control group, despite the presence of nonspecific signal originating from the blood. Imaging results were corroborated by histology and fluorescence imaging, suggesting specific binding of targeted NP to α(ν)β(3) integrin. Two other groups of mice were injected 24 h before imaging to allow blood clearance but no significant differences were found between both groups, probably due to a loss of specificity of PFOB NP.

	abstract = {Normal cognitive development in infants follows a well-known temporal sequence, which is assumed to be correlated with the structural maturation of underlying functional networks. Postmortem studies and, more recently, structural MR imaging studies have described qualitatively the heterogeneous spatiotemporal progression of white matter myelination. However, in vivo quantification of the maturation phases of fiber bundles is still lacking. We used noninvasive diffusion tensor MR imaging and tractography in twenty-three 1-4-month-old healthy infants to quantify the early maturation of the main cerebral fascicles. A specific maturation model, based on the respective roles of different maturational processes on the diffusion phenomena, was designed to highlight asynchronous maturation across bundles by evaluating the time-course of mean diffusivity and anisotropy changes over the considered developmental period. Using an original approach, a progression of maturation in four relative stages was determined in each tract by estimating the maturation state and speed, from the diffusion indices over the infants group compared with an adults group on one hand, and in each tract compared with the average over bundles on the other hand. Results were coherent with, and extended previous findings in 8 of 11 bundles, showing the anterior limb of the internal capsule and cingulum as the most immature, followed by the optic radiations, arcuate and inferior longitudinal fascicles, then the spinothalamic tract and fornix, and finally the corticospinal tract as the most mature bundle. Thus, this approach provides new quantitative landmarks for further noninvasive research on brain-behavior relationships during normal and abnormal development.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A promise of ultra high field MRI is to produce images of the human brain with higher spatial resolution due to an increased signal to noise ratio. Yet, the shorter radiofrequency wavelength induces an inhomogeneous distribution of the transmit magnetic field and thus challenges the applicability of MRI sequences which rely on the spin excitation homogeneity. In this work, the ability of parallel-transmission to obtain high-quality T2 -weighted images of the human brain at 7 Tesla, using an original pulse design method is evaluated.
METHODS: Excitation and refocusing square pulses of a SPACE sequence were replaced with short nonselective transmit-SENSE pulses individually tailored with the gradient ascent pulse engineering algorithm, adopting a kT -point trajectory to simultaneously mitigate B1 (+) and ΔB0 nonuniformities.
RESULTS: In vivo experiments showed that exploiting parallel-transmission at 7T with the proposed methodology produces high quality T2 -weighted whole brain images with uniform signal and contrast. Subsequent white and gray matter segmentation confirmed the expected improvements in image quality.
CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that the adopted formalism based on optimal control, combined with the kT -point method, successfully enables three-dimensional T2 -weighted brain imaging at 7T devoid of artifacts resulting from B1 (+) inhomogeneity.},

	abstract = {Parallel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yields noisy magnitude data, described in most cases as following a noncentral χ distribution when the signals received by the coils are combined as the sum of their squares. One well-known case of this noncentral χ noise model is the Rician model, but it is only valid in the case of single-channel acquisition. Although the use of parallel MRI is increasingly common, most of the correction methods still perform Rician noise removal, yielding an erroneous result due to an incorrect noise model. Moreover, the existence of noise correlations in phased array systems renders noise nonstationary and further modifies the noise description in parallel MRI. However, the noncentral χ model has been demonstrated to work as a good approximation as long as effective voxelwise parameters are used. A good correction step, adapted to the right noise model, is of paramount importance, especially when working with diffusion-weighted MR data, whose signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this paper, we present a noise removal technique designed to be fast enough for integration into a real-time reconstruction system, thus offering the convenience of obtaining corrected data almost instantaneously during the MRI scan. Our method employs the noncentral χ noise model and uses a simplified method to account for noise correlations; this leads to an efficient and rapid correction. The method consists of an anisotropic extension of the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error estimator (LMMSE) that is a far better edge-preserving method than the traditional LMMSE and addresses noncentral χ distributions along with empirically computed global effective parameters. The results on simulated and real data demonstrate that this anisotropic extended LMMSE outperforms the original LMMSE on images corrupted by noncentral χ noise. Moreover, in comparison with the existing LMMSE technique incorporating the estimation of voxelwise effective parameters, our method yields improved results.},

	abstract = {Pathological iron deposits in the brain, especially within basal ganglia, are linked to severe neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. As iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes in magnetic relaxation (T2/T2'), is often prone, however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity. Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus, reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Standard radiofrequency pulse design strategies focus on minimizing the deviation of the flip angle from a target value, which is sufficient but not necessary for signal homogeneity. An alternative approach, based directly on the signal, here is proposed for the MPRAGE sequence, and is developed in the parallel transmission framework with the use of the kT -points parametrization.
METHODS: The flip angle-homogenizing and the proposed methods were investigated numerically under explicit power and specific absorption rate constraints and tested experimentally in vivo on a 7 T parallel transmission system enabling real time local specific absorption rate monitoring. Radiofrequency pulse performance was assessed by a careful analysis of the signal and contrast between white and gray matter.
RESULTS: Despite a slight reduction of the flip angle uniformity, an improved signal and contrast homogeneity with a significant reduction of the specific absorption rate was achieved with the proposed metric in comparison with standard pulse designs.
CONCLUSION: The proposed joint optimization of the inversion and excitation pulses enables significant reduction of the specific absorption rate in the MPRAGE sequence while preserving image quality. The work reported thus unveils a possible direction to increase the potential of ultra-high field MRI and parallel transmission.

This paper presents a groupwise connectivity-based parcellation framework for the whole cortical surface using a new high quality diffusion dataset of 79 healthy subjects. Our approach performs gyrus by gyrus to parcellate the whole human cortex. The main originality of the method is to compress for each gyrus the connectivity profiles used for the clustering without any anatomical prior information. This step takes into account the interindividual cortical and connectivity variability. To this end, we consider intersubject high density connectivity areas extracted using a surface-based watershed algorithm. A wide validation study has led to a fully automatic pipeline which is robust to variations in data preprocessing (tracking type, cortical mesh characteristics and boundaries of initial gyri), data characteristics (including number of subjects), and the main algorithmic parameters. A remarkable reproducibility is achieved in parcellation results for the whole cortex, leading to clear and stable cortical patterns. This reproducibility has been tested across non-overlapping subgroups and the validation is presented mainly on the pre- and postcentral gyri.},

However, because the DfMRI response also contains a residual sensitivity to BOLD this hypothesis has been challenged. Using a verbal working memory task we show that the DfMRI time-course features are preserved outside visual cortices, but also less liable to between-subject/between-regional variation than the BOLD response. The overall findings not only support the feasibility of DfMRI as an approach for functional brain imaging, but also strengthen the uniqueness of the DfMRI signal origin.},

	abstract = {At ultra-high magnetic field (≥ 7T), B1 and ΔB0 non-uniformities cause undesired inhomogeneities in image signal and contrast. Tailored radiofrequency pulses exploiting parallel transmission have been shown to mitigate these phenomena. However, the design of large flip angle excitations, a prerequisite for many clinical applications, remains challenging due the non-linearity of the Bloch equation. In this work, we explore the potential of gradient ascent pulse engineering to design non-selective spin-echo refocusing pulses that simultaneously mitigate severe B1 and ΔB0 non-uniformities. The originality of the method lays in the optimization of the rotation matrices themselves as opposed to magnetization states. Consequently, the commonly used linear class of large tip angle approximation can be eliminated from the optimization procedure. This approach, combined with optimal control, provides additional degrees of freedom by relaxing the phase constraint on the rotation axis, and allows the derivative of the performance criterion to be found analytically. The method was experimentally validated on an 8-channel transmit array at 7T, using a water phantom with B1 and ΔB0 inhomogeneities similar to those encountered in the human brain. For the first time in MRI, the rotation matrix itself on every voxel was measured by using Quantum Process Tomography. The results are complemented with a series of spin-echo measurements comparing the proposed method against commonly used alternatives. Both experiments confirm very good performance, while simultaneously maintaining a low energy deposition and pulse duration compared to well-known adiabatic solutions.},

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate on two different 7T systems respectively equipped with 8-transmit-channel RF coils from two different suppliers (Rapid-Biomed and Nova Medical), the benefit of so-called universal pulses (UP), optimized to produce uniform excitations in the brain in a population of adults and making unnecessary the calibration procedures mentioned above. Non-selective and slice-selective UPs were designed to return homogeneous excitation profiles throughout the brain simultaneously on a group of ten subjects, which then were subsequently tested on ten additional volunteers in magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and multi-slice gradient echo (2D GRE) protocols. The results were additionally compared experimentally with the standard non-pTx circularly-polarized (CP) mode, and in simulation with subject-specific tailored excitations. For both pulse types and both coils, the UP mode returned a better signal and contrast homogeneity than the CP mode. Retrospective analysis of the flip angle (FA) suggests that the FA deviation from the nominal FA on average over a healthy adult population does not exceed 11\% with the calibration-free parallel-transmit pulses whereas it goes beyond 25\% with the CP mode. As a result the universal pulses designed in this work confirm their relevance in 3D and 2D protocols with commercially available equipment. Plug-and-play pTx implementations henceforth become accessible to exploit with more flexibility the potential of UHF for brain imaging.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A multispoke specific absorption rate (SAR) -aware pulse design approach for homogeneous multiple-slice small and large flip angle (FA) excitations with parallel transmission is proposed. The approach aims at optimizing in a slice-specific manner the spokes locations and radiofrequency pulses.
METHODS: The problem is posed as a set of slice-specific magnitude-least-squares problems, linked together by hardware and SAR constraints, and solved jointly using an active-set algorithm. Average Hamiltonian theory is exploited in the large FA case to greatly reduce the computational burden. The approach is validated numerically by means of simulations and experimentally on two volunteers at 7 Tesla through application of a high-resolution T2*-weighted brain imaging protocol.
RESULTS: The optimization of up to 1300 variables under 745 explicit constraints could be performed in less than 1 and 4 min for the small and large FA cases, respectively. The joint design proves valuable for SAR demanding protocols. Compared with the conventional circularly polarized mode, the designed pulses increased the signal by more than 40\% in 70\% of the voxels.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: T2 -weighted sequences are particularly sensitive to the radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity problem at ultra-high-field because of the errors accumulated by the imperfections of the train of refocusing pulses. As parallel transmission (pTx) has proved particularly useful to counteract RF heterogeneities, universal pulses were recently demonstrated to save precious time and computational efforts by skipping B1 calibration and online RF pulse tailoring. Here, we report a universal RF pulse design for non-selective refocusing pulses to mitigate the RF inhomogeneity problem at 7T in turbo spin-echo sequences with variable flip angles.
METHOD: Average Hamiltonian theory was used to synthetize a single non-selective refocusing pulse with pTx while optimizing its scaling properties in the presence of static field offsets. The design was performed under explicit power and specific absorption rate constraints on a database of 10 subjects using a 8Tx-32Rx commercial coil at 7T. To validate the proposed design, the RF pulses were tested in simulation and applied in vivo on 5 additional test subjects.
RESULTS: The root-mean-square rotation angle error (RA-NRMSE) evaluation and experimental data demonstrated great improvement with the proposed universal pulses (RA-NRMSE ∼8\%) compared to the standard circularly polarized mode of excitation (RA-NRMSE ∼26\%).
CONCLUSION: This work further completes the spectrum of 3D universal pulses to mitigate RF field inhomogeneity throughout all 3D MRI sequences without any pTx calibration. The approach returns a single pulse that can be scaled to match the desired flip angle train, thereby increasing the modularity of the proposed plug and play approach.

This unique insight into both tissue microstructure and connectivity has enormous potential value in understanding the structure and organization of the brain as well as providing unique insights to abnormalities that underpin disease states. The CONNECT (Consortium Of Neuroimagers for the Non-invasive Exploration of brain Connectivity and Tracts) project aimed to combine tractography and micro-structural measures of the living human brain in order to obtain a better estimate of the connectome, while also striving to extend validation of these measurements. This paper summarizes the project and describes the perspective of using micro-structural measures to study the connectome.},

Using fMRI data from 64 subjects (including 16 monozygotic (MZ) and 13 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs), we investigated how activations evoked by written words, faces, and spoken language are co-lateralized in the temporal lobe, and whether this organization reflects genetic factors or individual reading expertise. We found that the lateralization of the left superior temporal activation for spoken language correlates with the lateralization of occipitotemporal activations for both written words and faces. Behavioral reading scores also modulate the responses to words and faces. Estimation of genetic and environmental contributions shows that activations of the VWFA, the occipital face area, and the temporal speech areas are partially under genetic control whereas activation of the FFA is primarily influenced by individual experience. Our results stress the importance of both genetic factors and acquired expertise in the occipitotemporal organization.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether readout-segmented echo-planar imaging (RS-EPI) diffusion weighted image (DWI) can diminish image distortion in the head and neck area, compared with single-shot (SS)-EPI DWI.
METHODS: We conducted phantom and patient studies using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a 16-channel coil. For the phantom study, we evaluated distortion and signal homogeneity in gel phantoms. For the patient study, 29 consecutive patients with clinically suspicious parotid lesions were prospectively enrolled. RS-EPI and SS-EPI DWI were evaluated by two independent readers for identification of organ/lesion and distortion, using semiquantitative scales and quantitative scores. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values and contrast-noise ratios of parotid tumours (if present; n = 15) were also compared.
RESULTS: The phantom experiments showed that RS-EPI provided less distorted and more homogeneous ADC maps than SS-EPI. In the patient study, RS-EPI was found to provide significantly less distortion in almost all organs/lesions (p {\textless} 0.05), according to both semiquantitative scales and quantitative scores. There was no significant difference in ADC values and contrast-noise ratios between the two DWI techniques.
CONCLUSIONS: The distortion in DWI was significantly reduced with RS-EPI in both phantom and patient studies. The RS-EPI technique provided more homogenous images than SS-EPI, and can potentially offer higher image quality in the head and neck area.
KEY POINTS: The distortion in DWI is significantly reduced with RS-EPI compared with SS-EPI. Structures in the head and neck were identified more clearly using RS-EPI. No significant difference in ADC values was found between the techniques.},

In addition, steady-state Laplace PDEs can be formulated to produce the homogenized diffusion tensor that describes the diffusion characteristics of the medium in the long time limit. In spatial domains that model biological tissues at the cellular level, these two types of PDEs have to be completed with permeability conditions on the cellular interfaces. To solve these PDEs, we implemented a finite elements method that allows jumps in the solution at the cell interfaces by using double nodes. Using a transformation of the Bloch–Torrey PDE we reduced oscillations in the searched-for solution and simplified the implementation of the boundary conditions. The spatial discretization was then coupled to the adaptive explicit Runge–Kutta–Chebyshev time-stepping method. Our proposed method is second order accurate in space and second order accurate in time. We implemented this method on the FEniCS C++ platform and show time and spatial convergence results. Finally, this method is applied to study some relevant questions in diffusion MRI.},

	abstract = {Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is an imaging modality that probes the diffusion characteristics of a sample via the application of magnetic field gradient pulses. The dMRI signal from a heterogeneous sample includes the contribution of the water proton magnetization from all spatial positions in a voxel. If the voxel can be spatially divided into different Gaussian diffusion compartments with inter-compartment exchange governed by linear kinetics, then the dMRI signal can be approximated using the macroscopic Karger model, which is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), under the assumption that the duration of the diffusion-encoding gradient pulses is short compared to the diffusion time (the narrow pulse assumption). Recently, a new macroscopic model of the dMRI signal, without the narrow pulse restriction, was derived from the Bloch-Torrey partial differential equation (PDE) using periodic homogenization techniques. When restricted to narrow pulses, this new homogenized model has the same form as the Karger model. We conduct a numerical study of the new homogenized model for voxels that are made up of periodic copies of a representative volume that contains spherical and cylindrical cells of various sizes and orientations and show that the signal predicted by the new model approaches the reference signal obtained by solving the full Bloch-Torrey PDE in O(ε(2)), where ε is the ratio between the size of the representative volume and a measure of the diffusion length. When the narrow gradient pulse assumption is not satisfied, the new homogenized model offers a much better approximation of the full PDE signal than the Karger model. Finally, preliminary results of applying the new model to a voxel that is not made up of periodic copies of a representative volume are shown and discussed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of non-Gaussian diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MRI for the diagnosis of breast lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 26 women with breast lesions. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using 16 b values up to 2500 s/mm and analyzed using a kurtosis diffusion model (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC0] and kurtosis [K]) for the diffusion component and IVIM model (perfusion fraction [fIVIM] and pseudodiffusion coefficient [D*]) for the perfusion component. Diagnostic performance of diffusion and perfusion parameters was evaluated from receiver operating characteristic analyses.
RESULTS: The ADC0 in malignant lesions was significantly lower than that in benign lesions and normal tissue (P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas K was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05, P {\textless} 0.001), as well as fIVIM (P {\textless} 0.05, P {\textless} 0.01). No significant difference was found in D*. The receiver operating characteristic analysis gave high area under the curve values for ADC0, K, and fIVIM for distinguishing malignant from benign lesions (0.99, 0.85, and 0.82, respectively). The ADC0 allowed benign tumors to be identified with 100\% negative predictive value and malignant tumors with 100\% sensitivity. The malignant/benign diagnosis thresholds were 1.4 × 10 mm/s as well as 0.6 and 7\%, respectively, for ADC0, K, and fIVIM.
CONCLUSIONS: With a proper methodological framework, IVIM MRI can provide valuable information on tissue structure and microvasculature beneficial for the diagnosis of breast cancer lesions.},

For a large set of randomly generated dendrite trees, synthetic dMRI signals are computed and fitted to a cylinder model to estimate the effective longitudinal diffusivity D(L) in the direction of neurites. When the dendrite branches are short compared to the diffusion length, D(L) depends significantly on the ratio between the average branch length and the diffusion length. In turn, D(L) has very weak dependence on the distribution of branch lengths and orientations of a dendrite tree, and the number of branches per node. We conclude that the cylinder model which ignores the connectivity of the dendrite tree, can still be adapted to describe the apparent diffusion coefficient in brain tissue.},

Rather, non-Gaussian water diffusion properties emerge, which in cellular tissues are, in part, influenced by the intracellular environment that is not well evaluated by conventional DWI. The novel technique, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), enables characterization of non-Gaussian water diffusion behavior. More advanced mathematical curve fitting of the signal intensity decay curve using the DKI model provides an additional parameter Kapp that presumably reflects heterogeneity and irregularity of cellular microstructure, as well as the amount of interfaces within cellular tissues. Although largely applied for neural applications over the past decade, a small number of studies have recently explored DKI outside the brain. The most investigated organ is the prostate, with preliminary studies suggesting improved tumor detection and grading using DKI. Although still largely in the research phase, DKI is being explored in wider clinical settings. When assessing extracranial applications of DKI, careful attention to details with which body radiologists may currently be unfamiliar is important to ensure reliable results. Accordingly, a robust understanding of DKI is necessary for radiologists to better understand the meaning of DKI-derived metrics in the context of different tumors and how these metrics vary between tumor types and in response to treatment. In this review, we outline DKI principles, propose biostructural basis for observations, provide a comparison with standard monoexponential fitting and the apparent diffusion coefficient, report on extracranial clinical investigations to date, and recommend technical considerations for implementation in body imaging.},

Since then, diffusion MR imaging has become a pillar of modern clinical imaging. Diffusion MR imaging has mainly been used to investigate neurologic disorders. A dramatic application of diffusion MR imaging has been acute brain ischemia, providing patients with the opportunity to receive suitable treatment at a stage when brain tissue might still be salvageable, thus avoiding terrible handicaps. On the other hand, it was found that water diffusion is anisotropic in white matter, because axon membranes limit molecular movement perpendicularly to the nerve fibers. This feature can be exploited to produce stunning maps of the orientation in space of the white matter tracts and brain connections in just a few minutes. Diffusion MR imaging is now also rapidly expanding in oncology, for the detection of malignant lesions and metastases, as well as monitoring. Water diffusion is usually largely decreased in malignant tissues, and body diffusion MR imaging, which does not require any tracer injection, is rapidly becoming a modality of choice to detect, characterize, or even stage malignant lesions, especially for breast or prostate cancer. After a brief summary of the key methodological concepts beyond diffusion MR imaging, this article will give a review of the clinical literature, mainly focusing on current outstanding issues, followed by some innovative proposals for future improvements.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: A calibration-free parallel transmission method is investigated to mitigate the radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity problem in brain imaging at 7 Tesla (T).
THEORY AND METHODS: Six volunteers were scanned to build a representative database of RF and static field maps at 7T. Small-tip-angle and inversion pulses were designed with joint kT -points trajectory optimization to work robustly on all six subjects. The returned "universal" pulses were then inserted in an MPRAGE sequence implemented on six additional volunteers without further field measurements and pulse optimizations. Similar acquisitions were performed in the circularly polarized mode and with subject-based optimizations for comparison. Performance of the different approaches was evaluated by means of image analysis and computation of the flip angle normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE).
RESULTS: For both the excitation and inversion, the universal pulses (NRMSE∼11\%) outperformed the circularly polarized (NRMSE∼28\%) and RF shim modes (NRMSE∼20\%) across all volunteers and returned slightly worse results than for subject-based optimized pulses (NRMSE∼7\%).
CONCLUSION: RF pulses can be designed to robustly mitigate the RF field inhomogeneity problem over a population class. This appears as a first step toward another plug and play parallel transmission solution where the pulse design can be done offline and without measuring subject-specific field maps.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A fine structure of the corpus callosum (CC), consisting of radial lines, is seen in historical anatomical atlases as far back as that of Vicq d'Azyr (1786). This study examines a similar pattern observed in vivo using high-resolution MR images at 7 T.
METHODS: 8 healthy subjects were examined with 7.0-T MRI. Anatomical images were collected with a gradient echo scan with 0.5-mm isotropic resolution, which were rated for visibility of the radial pattern. In addition, the second eigenvector of the diffusion tensor images was examined.
RESULTS: The fine radial lines are detected not only in the sagittal view but also in the axial view of the in vivo MR images. From this, it is likely that these structures are two-dimensional ribbons. Interestingly, and confirming the structural nature of these stripes, the second eigenvector of the diffusion tensor imaging data shows an extremely similar pattern of oriented foliate structure. A similar modular structure involving transient septa has been observed previously in histological sections of human fetal CC.
CONCLUSION: The separate sets of data-the atlas of Klingler, anatomical images and second eigenvector images-all indicate a ribbon-like arrangement of the fibres in the CC. As such, they closely match the structures shown in the drawn atlases of as old as 1786. Advances in knowledge: This ribbon arrangement of fibres in the CC, previously unseen in CT or lower field MRI, can now be observed in vivo. This appears to match over two centuries of ex vivo observations.},

In the early 2000s the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission launched a program to conceive and build a ‘human brain explorer’, the first human MRI scanner operating at 11.7 T. This scanner was envisioned to be part of the ambitious French–German project Iseult, bridging together industrial and academic partners to push the limits of molecular neuroimaging, from mouse to man, using ultra-high field MRI. In this article we provide a summary of the main neuroscience and medical targets of the Iseult project, mainly to acquire within timescales compatible with human tolerances images at a scale of100 μ m at which everything remains to discover, and to create new approaches to develop new imaging biomarkers for specific neurological and psychiatric disorders. The system specifications, the technological challenges, in terms of magnet design, winding technology, cryogenics, quench protection, stability control, and the solutions which have been chosen to overcome them and build this outstanding instrument are provided. Lines of the research and development which will be necessary to fully exploit the potential of this and other UHF MRI scanners are also outlined.},

	doi = {10.1002/mrm.26614},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Small gradient delays with respect to radiofrequency (RF) events can have disastrous effects on the performance of bipolar spokes RF pulses used in parallel transmission (pTx). In this work, we propose a new method to characterize and correct this delay with sub-µs precision.
METHODS: By determining experimentally the phase Δφ producing a 0 ° flip angle excitation in a α0°-α180°+Δφ bipolar two-spoke pulse configuration at multiple slice locations, we demonstrate the possibility of deducing the underlying gradient delay with precision. The technique also suggests prospectively compensating for the same delay by altering the phase of the second pulse. The approach was tested with a multislice gradient echo sequence on a phantom and on one healthy volunteer at 7 Tesla.
RESULTS: Application of the method returned an accuracy of approximately 50 ns on the gradient delay measurement, a performance shown in fact to be desirable for high-performance pTx 2D applications. Phase corrections of up to 180 ° on the second spoke RF pulse in the bipolar configuration allowed us to obtain similar performance as for unipolar designs, yet with significantly shorter excitations.
CONCLUSIONS: A simple and accurate gradient-delay calibration method was proposed that offers the possibility of using bipolar multispoke pulses in multislice protocols. Magn Reson Med 78:2194-2202, 2017. © 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.},

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate the potential of diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to provide quantitative estimates of tissue stiffness without using mechanical vibrations in patients with chronic liver diseases and to generate a new elasticity-driven intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) contrast. Materials and Methods This retrospective study, conducted from January to April 2016, was approved by an institutional review board that waived the requirement for informed consent. Fifteen subjects were included (13 men and two women; mean age ± standard deviation, 73 years ± 8). MR elastography and diffusion MR imaging were performed at 3 T. A search for an empirical relationship between MR elastographic shear modulus, µMRE, and a shifted apparent diffusion coefficient (sADC) was performed. The sADC was then inverted to estimate patient liver shear modulus directly from diffusion MR imaging signals. Results A significant correlation (r2 = 0.90, P = 1 · 10-7) was observed between µMRE and sADC calculated by using diffusion MR imaging signals acquired with b values of 200 (S200) and 1500 (S1500 ) sec/mm2 (sACD200-1500). On the basis of the relationship between the µMRE and sADC200-1500, a diffusion-based shear modulus, µdiff, could be estimated with the following equation: µdiff = (-9.8 ± 0.8) ln(S200/S1500) + (14.0 ± 0.9). IVIM virtual elastograms also could be generated to reveal new contrast features in lesions, depending on pseudovibration frequency and amplitude. Conclusion Diffusion MR imaging, through a calibration of sADC200-1500 with standard MR elastography, can be converted quantitatively into shear modulus without using mechanical vibrations to provide information on the degree of liver fibrosis; these virtual elastograms require only two b values to be acquired and processed. Propagating shear wave can also be emulated, leading to a new elasticity-driven IVIM contrast with ranges of virtual vibration frequencies and amplitudes not limited by MR elastography or MR imaging hardware capacities. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To demonstrate that fast-kz spokes can be used in parallel transmission to homogenize flip angle ramp profiles (known as TONE) in slab selections, and thereby improve Time-Of-Flight angiography of the whole human brain at 7T.
METHODS: B1+ and B0 maps were measured on seven human brains with a z-segmented coil connected to an 8-channel pTx system. Tailored two-spoke pulses were designed under strict hardware and SAR constraints for uniform slab profile before transforming their subpulse waveforms for linearly-increasing flip-angle ramps. Increasing angulations along the feet-head direction were prescribed in 2-slab and 3-slab TOF acquisitions. Excitation patterns were simulated and compared with RF-shimmed (single spoke) ramp pulses. Excitation performances were assessed in {\textasciitilde}10-min TOF acquisitions by visually inspecting Maximal Intensity Projections angiograms.
RESULTS: The flip-angle ramp fidelity achieved by double spokes inside slabs of interest was improved by 30-40\% compared to RF-shimmed ramps. This allowed better homogenizing signal along arteries, and depicting small vessels in distal areas of the brain, in comparison with RF-shimmed ramp pulses or double-spoke uniform excitation.
CONCLUSION: Ramp double spokes used in conjunction with parallel transmission yield better blood saturation compensation and more finely resolved TOF angiograms than mere double spokes or ramp single spokes at 7T.},

To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired from rats across 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for analyzing rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with the robust detection of functional connectivity across centers. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns relative to previous acquisitions.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To optimize the homogeneity of the presaturation module in a Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) acquisition at 7 T using parallel transmission (pTx).
THEORY AND METHODS: An optimized pTx-CEST presaturation scheme based on precomputed universal pulses was designed. The optimization was performed by minimizing the L2-norm between the effective    B 1 , RMS +   \$\$ \{B\}\_\{1,{\textbackslash}mathrm\{RMS\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\} \$\$  and a given target while imposing energy constraints under virtual observation points (VOPs) supervision. The proposed method was evaluated through simulations and experimentally, both in vitro, on a realistic human head phantom, and in vivo, on healthy volunteers. The results were compared with circular polarization (CP) presaturation and other pTx approaches previously proposed. All experiments were conducted on a 7 T MRI scanner using a commercial 8Tx/32Rx head coil.
RESULTS: The simulations show that the proposed pTx strategy boosted with VOPs is superior to the CP mode and existent pTx approaches. While the best results are obtained with subject specific pulses, the gain provided by the use of VOPs renders the universal pulses superior to tailored pulses optimized under vendor provided Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) management. In the phantom, the glucose    MTR asym   \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{MTR\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{asym\}\} \$\$  map was significantly more homogeneous than with CP (root mean square error [RMSE] 17\% vs. 30\%). The efficiency of the method for in vivo hydroxyl, glutamate and rNOE weighted CEST acquisitions was also demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: The use of a pTx presaturation scheme based on universal pulses optimized under VOP SAR management is significantly benefiting CEST imaging at high magnetic field.},

                ‐weighted sequences are particularly sensitive to the radiofrequency (RF) field inhomogeneity problem at ultra‐high‐field because of the errors accumulated by the imperfections of the train of refocusing pulses. As parallel transmission (pTx) has proved particularly useful to counteract RF heterogeneities, universal pulses were recently demonstrated to save precious time and computational efforts by skipping B

                calibration and online RF pulse tailoring. Here, we report a universal RF pulse design for non‐selective refocusing pulses to mitigate the RF inhomogeneity problem at 7T in turbo spin‐echo sequences with variable flip angles.
              
            
            
              Method
              Average Hamiltonian theory was used to synthetize a single non‐selective refocusing pulse with pTx while optimizing its scaling properties in the presence of static field offsets. The design was performed under explicit power and specific absorption rate constraints on a database of 10 subjects using a 8Tx‐32Rx commercial coil at 7T. To validate the proposed design, the RF pulses were tested in simulation and applied in vivo on 5 additional test subjects.
            
            
              Results
              The root‐mean‐square rotation angle error (RA‐NRMSE) evaluation and experimental data demonstrated great improvement with the proposed universal pulses (RA‐NRMSE ∼8\%) compared to the standard circularly polarized mode of excitation (RA‐NRMSE ∼26\%).
            
            
              Conclusion
              This work further completes the spectrum of 3D universal pulses to mitigate RF field inhomogeneity throughout all 3D MRI sequences without any pTx calibration. The approach returns a single pulse that can be scaled to match the desired flip angle train, thereby increasing the modularity of the proposed plug and play approach.

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer in women with a huge medical, social and economic impact. Mammography (MMG) has been the gold standard method until now because it is relatively inexpensive and widely available. However, MMG suffers from certain limitations, such as exposure to X-rays and difficulty of interpretation in dense breasts. Among other imaging methods, MRI has clearly the highest sensitivity and specificity, and breast MRI is the gold standard for the investigation and management of suspicious lesions revealed by MMG. Despite this performance, MRI, which does not rely on X-rays, is not used for screening except for a well-defined category of women at risk, because of its high cost and limited availability. In addition, the standard approach to breast MRI relies on Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI with the injection of Gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA), which have their own contraindications and can lead to deposit of gadolinium in tissues, including the brain, when examinations are repeated. On the other hand, diffusion MRI of breast, which provides information on tissue microstructure and tumor perfusion without the use of contrast agents, has been shown to offer higher specificity than DCE MRI with similar sensitivity, superior to MMG. Diffusion MRI thus appears to be a promising alternative approach to breast cancer screening, with the primary goal of eliminating with a very high probability the existence of a life-threatening lesion. To achieve this goal, it is first necessary to standardize the protocols for acquisition and analysis of diffusion MRI data, which have been found to vary largely in the literature. Second, the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of MRI examinations must be significantly improved, which may become possible with the development of dedicated low-field MRI units for breast cancer screening. In this article, we will first review the principles and current status of diffusion MRI, comparing its clinical performance with MMG and DCE MRI. We will then look at how breast diffusion MRI could be implemented and standardized to optimize accuracy of results. Finally, we will discuss how a dedicated, low-cost prototype of breast MRI system could be implemented and introduced to the healthcare market.},

Following the most recent developments in modern theoretical physics (black hole entropy, holographic principle, AdS/CFT duality), we conjecture that consciousness can naturally emerge from this four-dimensional brain connectome when a fifth dimension is considered, in the same way that gravity emerges from a ‘flat’ four-dimensional quantum world, without gravitation, present at the boundaries of a five-dimensional spacetime. This vision makes it possible to envisage quantitative signatures of consciousness based on the entropy of the connectome and the curvature of spacetime estimated from data obtained by fMRI in the resting state (nodal activity and functional connectivity) and constrained by the anatomical connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging.},

A parameter, kurtosis K, describes the deviation of the diffusion signal decay from a Gaussian pattern. The deviation reflects the complexity of the tissue microstructure affecting water diffusion. Several studies have investigated the diagnostic performance of DKI in distinguishing malignant from benign breast lesions. DKI has been reported to correlate with subtypes and with several molecular and other factors related to the treatment and prognosis of breast cancer. Some technical considerations remain to be resolved for the clinical application of DKI in the breast.

	abstract = {Background: Strong correlation has been reported between tissue water diffusivity and tissue elasticity in the liver. The purpose of this study is to explore the capability of diffusion–based virtual MR elastography (VMRE) in the characterization of liver tumors by extending beyond liver fibrosis assessments. Methods: Fifty-four patients (56 liver tumors: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 31; metastases, 25) who underwent MRE, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (b: 0, 800 s/mm2), and VMRE (b: 200, 1500 s/mm2) were enrolled. The MRE shear modulus (µMRE), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and shifted ADC (sADC) were obtained. Virtual stiffness (µdiff) was estimated from the relationship between µMRE and sADC. A linear discriminant analysis combining VMRE and MRE to classify HCC and metastases was performed in a training cohort (thirty-two patients) to estimate a classifier (C), and evaluate its accuracy in a testing cohort (twenty-two patients). Pearson’s correlations between µMRE, sADC, and ADC were evaluated. In addition to the discriminant analysis, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the discrimination capability between HCC and metastases. Results: The correlations between µMRE and sADC were significant for liver, HCC, and metastases (r = 0.91, 0.68, 0.71; all p {\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Those between µMRE and ADC were weaker and significant only for metastases (r = 0.17, 0.20, 0.55). µdiff values were not significantly different between HCC and metastases (p = 0.56). Areas under the curves (AUC) to differentiate HCC from metastases were as follows: VMRE, 0.46; MRE alone, 0.89; MRE + VMRE, 0.96. The classifier C also provided better performance than MRE alone, in terms of sensitivity (100 vs. 93.5\%, respectively) and specificity (92 vs. 76\%, respectively, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The correlation between sADC and µMRE was strong both in the liver and in tumors. However, VMRE alone could not classify HCC and metastases. The combination of MRE and VMRE, however, allowed discriminant performance between HCC and metastases.},

	abstract = {Understanding the relationships between biological processes is paramount to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms. These relationships can be modeled with Transfer Functions (TFs), with no need of a priori hypotheses as to the shape of the transfer function. Here we present Iliski, a software dedicated to TFs computation between two signals. It includes different pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes: deconvolution, deterministic and non-deterministic optimization algorithms that are adapted to disparate datasets. We apply Iliski to data on neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cellular mechanisms that link neuronal activity to local changes of blood flow, highlighting the software benefits and caveats in the computation and evaluation of TFs. We also propose a workflow that will help users to choose the best computation according to the dataset. Iliski is available under the open-source license CC BY 4.0 on GitHub ( https://github.com/alike-aydin/Iliski ) and can be used on the most common operating systems, either within the MATLAB environment, or as a standalone application.},

	abstract = {Abstract The spatial-temporal sequence of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and blood velocity changes triggered by neuronal activation is critical for understanding functional brain imaging. This sequence follows a stereotypic pattern of changes across different zones of the vasculature in the olfactory bulb, the first relay of olfaction. However, in the cerebral cortex, where most human brain mapping studies are performed, the timing of activity evoked vascular events remains controversial. Here we utilized a single whisker stimulation model to map out functional hyperemia along vascular arbours from layer II/III to the surface of primary somatosensory cortex, in anesthetized and awake Thy1-GCaMP6 mice. We demonstrate that sensory stimulation triggers an increase in blood velocity within the mid-capillary bed and a dilation of upstream large capillaries, and the penetrating and pial arterioles. We report that under physiological stimulation, response onset times are highly variable across compartments of different vascular arbours. Furthermore, generating transfer functions (TFs) between neuronal Ca 2+ and vascular dynamics across different brain states demonstrates that anesthesia decelerates neurovascular coupling (NVC). This spatial-temporal pattern of vascular events demonstrates functional diversity not only between different brain regions but also at the level of different vascular arbours within supragranular layers of the cerebral cortex.},
